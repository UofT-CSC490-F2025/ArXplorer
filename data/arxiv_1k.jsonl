The intelligent locator comprises a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is avoided.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link. These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate. The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2) establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail; and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.", "categories": ["cs.it", "cs.lg", "math.it"], "authors": ["Soummya Kar", "Jose M.

In a setting generalizing the multi-armed bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by a quantity that is proportional to 1/\\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual edges on the path.

This identity potentially provides a new application domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample locations to the associated values of the integrand.

Manual resource discovery is a slow process, requiring the user to sift through results obtained via keyword-based search. Although search methods have advanced to include evidence from document contents, its metadata and the contents and link structure of the referring pages, they still do not adequately cover information sources -- often called ``the hidden Web''-- that dynamically generate documents in response to a query. The recently popular social bookmarking sites, which allow users to annotate and share metadata about various information sources, provide rich evidence for resource discovery. In this paper, we describe a probabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking system del.icio.us.

Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or searching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a specific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an insect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not relevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim that users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in the form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this metadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search performance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision by filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network that includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic model that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics contained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be described by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics found by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding images on topics that are of interest to the user.", "categories": ["cs.ir", "cs.ai", "cs.cy", "cs.dl", "cs.hc"], "authors": ["Kristina Lerman", "Anon Plangprasopchok", "Chio Wong"], "primary_category": "cs.ir", "published_date": "Thu, 12 Apr 2007 23:31:04 GMT", "updated_date": "Thu, 12 Apr 2007 23:31:04 GMT"}

The second step consists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic Programming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best paths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on them (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems. Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics.

This large mobilization of tribologists, material sciences specialists and physicists has lead to emerging solutions involving new materials and coatings, the most promising being carbon based like graphite, diamond, carbon composites or diamond-like-carbons. Some of them are currently used in practical applications. The situation is different especially in EHL: the highest friction coefficients are close to 10% when traction fluids are involved, i.e. fluids that have especially designed to transmit the highest friction, and they vary within 3-6% for the rest of lubricants. The range of variation is consequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared to those obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a super low traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially in the case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales.

We present HMMER-STRUCT, a model construction algorithm and tool that tries to improve pHMM performance by using structural information while training pHMMs. As a first step, HMMER-STRUCT constructs a set of pHMMs. Each pHMM is constructed by weighting each residue in an aligned protein according to a specific structural property of the residue. Properties used were primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing. HMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP database to perform our experiments. Throughout, we apply leave-one-family-out cross-validation over protein superfamilies.

In a second experiment, we compared the voting model against individual pHMMs. We compare method performance through ROC curves and through Precision/Recall curves, and assess significance through the paired two tailed t-test.

The estimated Hamaker constant was in good agreement with the Lifshitz theory, and the dominant meniscus attraction at low separation could be overcome with small radius sphere.

The straggler identification problem has applications, for example, in determining the set of unacknowledged packets in a high-bandwidth multicast data stream. We provide a deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem that uses only O(d log n) bits and is based on a novel application of Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials. This solution can identify any subset of d stragglers from a set of n O(log n)-bit identifiers, assuming that there are no false deletions of identities not already in the set. Indeed, we give a lower bound argument that shows that any small-space deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem cannot be guaranteed to handle false deletions. Nevertheless, we show that there is a simple randomized solution using O(d log n log(1/epsilon)) bits that can maintain a multiset and solve the straggler identification problem, tolerating false deletions, where epsilon>0 is a user-defined parameter bounding the probability of an incorrect response.

Thus, the intrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known) network properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use and, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying grammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic relations.

In the meanwhile, Ensemble Learning, one of the most efficient approaches in supervised Machine Learning for the last decade, proceeds by building a population of diverse classifiers. Ensemble Learning with Evolutionary Computation thus receives increasing attention. The Evolutionary Ensemble Learning (EEL) approach presented in this paper features two contributions. First, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and enforcing the classifier diversity, is presented. Further, a new selection criterion based on the classification margin is proposed. This criterion is used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only (Off-line) or incrementally along evolution (On-line).

Image processing techniques are used to assist in the spatial indexing of the data. A fixed grid approach is used and bins with too many records are sub-divided hierarchically. Search queries are pre-computed for bins that do not contain any data records. This has the effect of dividing the search space up into non rectangular regions which are based on the spatial properties of the data. The bucketing quad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two for each layer. The results show that this method performs better than the quad tree if there are more divisions per layer. This confirms our suspicions that the algorithm works better if it gets to look at the data with higher resolution images.

The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of an inductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network. Recursive neural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised and non-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclic graphs. The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through well predefined scenarios.

While it has been successfully employed in a wide variety of applications, there are relatively few theoretical guarantees of convergence and correctness for general loopy graphs that may have many short cycles. Of these, even fewer provide exact ``necessary and sufficient'' characterizations.   In this paper we investigate the problem of using max-product to find the maximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph with edge weights. This is done by first constructing a probability distribution whose mode corresponds to the optimal matching, and then running max-product. Weighted matching can also be posed as an integer program, for which there is an LP relaxation. This relaxation is not always tight. In this paper we show that \\begin{enumerate} \\item If the LP relaxation is tight, then max-product always converges, and that too to the correct answer. \\item If the LP relaxation is loose, then max-product does not converge. \\end{enumerate} This provides an exact, data-dependent characterization of max-product performance, and a precise connection to LP relaxation, which is a well-studied optimization technique. Also, since LP relaxation is known to be tight for bipartite graphs, our results generalize other recent results on using max-product to find weighted matchings in bipartite graphs.", "categories": ["cs.it", "cs.ai", "cs.lg", "cs.ni", "math.it"], "authors": ["Sujay Sanghavi"], "primary_category": "cs.it", "published_date": "Sat, 5 May 2007 18:57:47 GMT", "updated_date": "Sat, 5 May 2007 18:57:47 GMT"}

Meshes computations form the basis of many applications, e.g. finite-element methods, image rendering, and collision detection. In one important mesh primitive, called a mesh update, each mesh vertex stores a value and repeatedly updates this value based on the values stored in all neighboring vertices. The performance of a mesh update depends on the layout of the mesh in memory.   This paper shows how to find a memory layout that guarantees that the mesh update has asymptotically optimal memory performance for any set of memory parameters. Such a memory layout is called cache-oblivious. Formally, for a $d$-dimensional mesh $G$, block size $B$, and cache size $M$ (where $M=\\Omega(B^d)$), the mesh update of $G$ uses $O(1+|G|/B)$ memory transfers. The paper also shows how the mesh-update performance degrades for smaller caches, where $M=o(B^d)$.   The paper then gives two algorithms for finding cache-oblivious mesh layouts. The first layout algorithm runs in time $O(|G|\\log^2|G|)$ both in expectation and with high probability on a RAM. It uses $O(1+|G|\\log^2(|G|/M)/B)$ memory transfers in expectation and $O(1+(|G|/B)(\\log^2(|G|/M) + \\log|G|))$ memory transfers with high probability in the cache-oblivious and disk-access machine (DAM) models. The layout is obtained by finding a fully balanced decomposition tree of $G$ and then performing an in-order traversal of the leaves of the tree. The second algorithm runs faster by almost a $\\log|G|/\\log\\log|G|$ factor in all three memory models, both in expectation and with high probability.

Frictionless systems assemble in the unique random close packing (RCP) state in the low pressure limit if the compression process is fast enough, slower processes inducing traces of crystallization, and exhibit specific properties directly related to isostaticity of the force-carrying structure. The different structures of frictional packings assembled by various methods cannot be classified by the sole density. While lubricated systems approach RCP densities and coordination number z^*~=6 on the backbone in the rigid limit, an idealized \"vibration\" procedure results in equally dense configurations with z^*~=4.5. Near neighbor correlations on various scales are computed and compared to available laboratory data, although z^* values remain experimentally inaccessible. Low coordination packings have many rattlers (more than 10% of the grains carry no force), which should be accounted for on studying position correlations, and a small proportion of harmless \"floppy modes\" associated with divalent grains.

Comparisons of numerical and experimental results for glass beads in the 10kPa-10MPa range reveal similar differences between dry samples compacted by vibrations and lubricated packings. The greater stiffness of the latter, in spite of their lower density, can hence be attributed to a larger coordination number. Voigt and Reuss bounds bracket bulk modulus B accurately, but simple estimation schemes fail for shear modulus G, especially in poorly coordinated configurations under low P. Tenuous, fragile networks respond differently to changes in load direction, as compared to load intensity. The shear modulus, in poorly coordinated packings, tends to vary proportionally to the degree of force indeterminacy per unit volume. The elastic range extends to small strain intervals, in agreement with experimental observations. The origins of nonelastic response are discussed.

These properties are important because they are the basis of most of the reasoning methods used to solve classical (existentially quantified) constraints, and one would like to benefit from similar reasoning methods in the resolution of quantified constraints. In this paper, we show that most of the properties that are used by solvers for CSP can be generalized to quantified CSP.

We propose a systematic study of the relations which hold between these properties, as well as complexity results regarding the decision of these properties.

The fact that the oscillators have a low number density (dilute medium) and have a narrow-band resonance allows us to simplify the integrand. In this case, the integral can be evaluated exactly, although it is not possible using this method to separate out the transient part of the propagated field known as optical precursors. We also use an asymptotic method (saddle-point method) to evaluate the integral. The contributions to the integral related to the saddle-points of the integrand give rise to the optical precursors. We obtain analytic expressions for the precursor fields and the domain over which the asymptotic method is valid. When combined to obtain the total transient field, we find that the agreement between the solutions obtained by the asymptotic and the exact methods is excellent.

To a game developer maintaining an MMOG, recognizing, monitoring, and ultimately controlling a virtual plague is important, regardless of how it was initiated. The prospect of using tools, methods and theory from the field of epidemiology to do this seems natural and appealing. We will address the feasibility of such a prospect, first by considering some basic measures used in epidemiology, then by pointing out the differences between real world epidemics and virtual plagues.

We consider the case of a textual database made of semi-structured documents. Each field, in turns, is modelled with a specific vector space. The problem is more complex when we also allow each such vector space to have an associated user-defined dynamic weight that influences its contribution to the overall dynamic aggregated and weighted similarity. This dynamic problem has been tackled in a recent paper by Singitham et al. in in VLDB 2004. Their proposed solution, which we take as baseline, is a variant of the cluster-pruning technique that has the potential for scaling to very large corpora of documents, and is far more efficient than the naive exhaustive search. We devise an alternative way of embedding weights in the data structure, coupled with a non-trivial application of a clustering algorithm based on the furthest point first heuristic for the metric k-center problem. The validity of our approach is demonstrated experimentally by showing significant performance improvements over the scheme proposed in Singitham et al. in VLDB 2004.

Fault classification was accomplished by implementing a series of virtual sensor models which used data from real sensors (Lam Station sensors, Optical Emission Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring) to predict recipe setpoints and wafer state characteristics. Fault detection and classification were performed by comparing predicted recipe and wafer state values with expected values. Models utilized include linear PLS, Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network PLS. Prediction of recipe setpoints based upon sensor data provides a capability for cross-checking that the machine is maintaining the desired setpoints. Wafer state characteristics such as Line Width Reduction and Remaining Oxide were estimated on-line using these same process sensors (Lam, OES, RFM). Wafer-to-wafer measurement of these characteristics in a production setting (where typically this information may be only sparsely available, if at all, after batch processing runs with numerous wafers have been completed) would provide important information to the operator that the process is or is not producing wafers within acceptable bounds of product quality.

The energy drift vanishes in the asymptotic limit. The time-energy probability distribution is in general not separable, as a result of nonstationarity.

This striking discovery has applications ranging from spectroscopy and metrology to telecommunication and medicine. Amongst the physical principles underlying supercontinuum generation are soliton fission, a variety of four-wave mixing processes, Raman induced soliton self-frequency shift, and dispersive wave generation mediated by solitons. Although all of the above effects contribute to supercontinuum generation none of them can explain the generation of blue and violet light from infrared femtosecond pump pulses, which has been seen already in the first observations of the supercontinuum in photonic crystal fibers. In this work we argue that the most profound role in the shaping of the short-wavelength edge of the continuum is played by the effect of radiation trapping in a gravity-like potential created by accelerating solitons. The underlying physics of this effect has a straightforward analogy with the inertial forces acting on an observer moving with a constant acceleration.", "categories": ["physics.optics", "physics.class-ph"], "authors": ["A.V.

The algorithm's novelty is limited to a few relatively minor implementation twists: 1) the two heaps are oriented with their roots at the partition values rather than at the minimum and maximum values, 2)the coding of one of the heaps (the heap of smaller values) employs negative indexing, and 3) the exchange phase of the algorithm is similar to a bottom-up heap construction, but navigates the heap with a post-order tree traversal.   When run on a single processor, the dualheap selection algorithm's performance is competitive with quickselect with median estimation, a common variant of C.A.R. Hoare's quicksort algorithm.

Given an error probability $\\epsilon$, together with a method that makes a prediction $\\hat{y}$ of a label $y$, it produces a set of labels, typically containing $\\hat{y}$, that also contains $y$ with probability $1-\\epsilon$. Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for producing $\\hat{y}$: a nearest-neighbor method, a support-vector machine, ridge regression, etc.   Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted. The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution, then the successive predictions will be right $1-\\epsilon$ of the time, even though they are based on an accumulating dataset rather than on independent datasets.   In addition to the model under which successive examples are sampled independently, other on-line compression models can also use conformal prediction. The widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these.   This tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of conformal prediction and works through several numerical examples.

First, in contrast with previous observations, the stick-slip regime appears to be only transient in the force controlled peeling. Additionally, we discover that the stick and slip phases have similar durations and that at high mean peeling velocity, the slip phase actually lasts longer than the stick phase. Depending on the mean peeling velocity, we also observe that the velocity change between stick and slip phase ranges from a rather sudden to a smooth transition.

The first key feature of the paper is the application of direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) introduced by Marchisio and Fox (2005) to the Williams spray equation. Both the multi-fluid method and DQMOM yield systems of Eulerian conservation equations with complicated interaction terms representing coalescence. In order to validate and compare these approaches, the chosen configuration is a self-similar 2D axisymmetrical decelerating nozzle with sprays having various size distributions, ranging from smooth ones up to Dirac delta functions.

The basic idea is as follows: fictitious values of the solution are built in vacuum, and injected into the numerical integration scheme near boundaries. The most original feature of this method is the way in which these fictitious values are calculated. They are based on boundary conditions and compatibility conditions satisfied by the successive spatial derivatives of the solution, up to a given order that depends on the spatial accuracy of the integration scheme adopted. Since the work is mostly done during the preprocessing step, the extra computational cost is negligible. Stress-free conditions can be designed at any arbitrary order without any numerical instability, as numerically checked. Using 10 grid nodes per minimal S-wavelength with a propagation distance of 50 wavelengths yields highly accurate results. With 5 grid nodes per minimal S-wavelength, the solution is less accurate but still acceptable. A subcell resolution of the boundary inside the Cartesian meshing is obtained, and the spurious diffractions induced by staircase descriptions of boundaries are avoided. Contrary to what occurs with the vacuum method, the quality of the numerical solution obtained with this method is almost independent of the angle between the free boundary and the Cartesian meshing.", "categories": ["physics.class-ph", "physics.geo-ph"], "authors": ["Bruno Lombard (LMA)", "Jo\\\"el Piraux (LMA)", "C\\'eline G\\'elis (GA)", "Jean\n  Virieux (GA)"], "primary_category": "physics.class-ph", "published_date": "Tue, 26 Jun 2007 13:21:01 GMT", "updated_date": "Tue, 11 Sep 2007 08:42:46 GMT"}

Moreover, the model takes into account the phase relationships of the small-scales, embodied for example in strong localized structures such as vortex filaments. To that effect, phase information is implemented in the treatment of the so-called eddy noise in the closure model. Finally, we also consider the role that helical small scales may play in the evaluation of the transfer of energy and helicity, the two invariants of the primitive equations in the inviscid case; this leads as well to intrinsic variations in the development of helicity spectra. Therefore, our model allows for simulations of flows for a variety of circumstances and a priori at any given Reynolds number.

We then apply our algorithm for k-forest to obtain approximation algorithms for several Dial-a-Ride problems. The basic Dial-a-Ride problem is the following: given an $n$ point metric space with $m$ objects each with its own source and destination, and a vehicle capable of carrying at most $k$ objects at any time, find the minimum length tour that uses this vehicle to move each object from its source to destination.

A comparative study of the scuba algorithm and standard local search heuristics has shown the advantage and the limitation of the scuba search. In order to tune neutrality, we use the NKq fitness landscapes and a family of travelling salesman problems (TSP) where cities are randomly placed on a lattice and where travel distance between cities is computed with the Manhattan metric.

The algorithm is similar to the standard `perceptron' learning algorithm, with an additional rule for synaptic transitions which occur only if a currently presented pattern is `barely correct'. In this case, the synaptic changes are meta-plastic only (change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the synapse in its current state.

Second, using this compact representation, we solve this problem as an instance of combinatorial optimization for which we formulate a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The optimal solution of the MILP directly yields an optimal joint-policy for the Dec-Pomdp.

The studies dealing with this phenomenon are seldom and most of the scientific work has been focused on flow electrification of aqueous and insulating Newtonian liquids. From that prior art it is well established that the flow electrification in Newtonian liquids is a consequence of the formation of an ionic double layer. Convection of this layer induces the electrification of the liquid at the outlet of the pipe. In those models, the key parameters governing the flow electrification are thus the intrinsic electrical properties of the polymer and the flow characteristics. In this work, we reconsider the assumptions made previously and we propose a new approach to modelise the flow electrification in the particular case of non-Newtonian polymer materials in laminar flow conditions. We establish that, a key parameter for the electrification quantification in the polymer melt is the shape of the velocity profile. Additionally, in some cases, we show that a slip velocity at the polymer/die wall interface must be considered to describe accurately the electrification. As a consequence, we deduce that the slip velocity at the interface can be calculated by measuring the electrification: this work gives an alternative manner to measure the slip velocity during polymer flow.", "categories": ["physics.class-ph"], "authors": ["F.

Such a comparison pattern provides a much more detailed picture of string similarity than a single LCS score; it also arises naturally in many string-related problems. In fact, the semi-local LCS problem turns out to be fundamental for string comparison, providing a powerful and flexible alternative to classical dynamic programming. It is especially useful when the input to a string comparison problem may not be available all at once: for example, comparison of dynamically changing strings; comparison of compressed strings; parallel string comparison. The same approach can also be applied to permutation strings, providing efficient solutions for local versions of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem, and for the problem of computing a maximum clique in a circle graph. Furthermore, the semi-local LCS problem turns out to have surprising connections in a few seemingly unrelated fields, such as computational geometry and algebra of semigroups.

The same problems often encourage reducing the maximal degree of vertices to simplify theoretical arguments or address practical concerns. Such degree reduction can be performed through a sequence of splittings of vertices, resulting in an _expansion_ of the original graph. We observe that the treewidth of a graph may increase dramatically if the splittings are not performed carefully. In this context we address the following natural question: is it possible to reduce the maximum degree to a constant without substantially increasing the treewidth?   Our work answers the above question affirmatively. We prove that any simple undirected graph G=(V, E) admits an expansion G'=(V', E') with the maximum degree <= 3 and treewidth(G') <= treewidth(G)+1. Furthermore, such an expansion will have no more than 2|E|+|V| vertices and 3|E| edges; it can be computed efficiently from a tree-decomposition of G. We also construct a family of examples for which the increase by 1 in treewidth cannot be avoided.", "categories": ["cs.dm", "cs.ds", "math.co", "quant-ph"], "authors": ["Igor Markov (University of Michigan)", "Yaoyun Shi (University of\n  Michigan)"], "primary_category": "cs.dm", "published_date": "Tue, 24 Jul 2007 19:56:27 GMT", "updated_date": "Tue, 24 Jul 2007 19:56:27 GMT"}

This information allows researchers to perform association studies for the genetic variants involved in diseases and the individual responses to therapeutic agents.   A notable approach to the problem is to encode it as a combinatorial problem (under certain hypotheses, such as the pure parsimony criterion) and to solve it using off-the-shelf combinatorial optimization techniques. The main methods applied to Haplotype Inference are either simple greedy heuristic or exact methods (Integer Linear Programming, Semidefinite Programming, SAT encoding) that, at present, are adequate only for moderate size instances.   We believe that metaheuristic and hybrid approaches could provide a better scalability. Moreover, metaheuristics can be very easily combined with problem specific heuristics and they can also be integrated with tree-based search techniques, thus providing a promising framework for hybrid systems in which a good trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency can be reached.   In this paper we illustrate a feasibility study of the approach and discuss some relevant design issues, such as modeling and design of approximate solvers that combine constructive heuristics, local search-based improvement strategies and learning mechanisms. Besides the relevance of the Haplotype Inference problem itself, this preliminary analysis is also an interesting case study because the formulation of the problem poses some challenges in modeling and hybrid metaheuristic solver design that can be generalized to other problems.", "categories": ["cs.ai", "cs.ce", "cs.dm", "q-bio.qm"], "authors": ["Luca Di Gaspero", "Andrea Roli"], "primary_category": "cs.ai", "published_date": "Fri, 3 Aug 2007 12:49:21 GMT", "updated_date": "Fri, 3 Aug 2007 12:49:21 GMT"}

The solutions correspond to a hierarchy of models that, at each level of complexity, achieve optimal predictive power at minimal cost. In the limit of maximal prediction the resulting optimal model identifies a process's intrinsic organization by extracting the underlying causal states. In this limit, the model's complexity is given by the statistical complexity, which is known to be minimal for achieving maximum prediction.

Second, in this model, we study the possibility of designing self-stabilizing algorithms when those algorithms are run by mobile robots (or agents) evolving on a graph.

The spectrum of the unperturbed gyroscopic system forms a \"spectral mesh\" in the plane \"frequency -gyroscopic parameter\" with double semi-simple purely imaginary eigenvalues at zero value of the gyroscopic parameter. It is shown that dissipative forces lead to the splitting of the semi-simple eigenvalue with the creation of the so-called \"bubble of instability\" - a ring in the three-dimensional space of the gyroscopic parameter and real and imaginary parts of eigenvalues, which corresponds to complex eigenvalues. In case of full dissipation with a positive-definite damping matrix the eigenvalues of the ring have negative real parts making the bubble a latent source of instability because it can \"emerge\" to the region of eigenvalues with positive real parts due to action of both indefinite damping and non-conservative positional forces. In the paper, the instability mechanism is analytically described with the use of the perturbation theory of multiple eigenvalues. As an example stability of a rotating circular string constrained by a stationary load system is studied in detail.

Such extensions have been carried out along with the development of efficient methods for obtaining nondiffracting beams and pulses in the subluminal, luminal and superluminal regimes[11-18]. This paper (partly a review) addresses some theoretical methods related to nondiffracting solutions of the linear wave equation in unbounded homogeneous media, as well as to some interesting applications of such waves. In section II we analyze the general structure of the Localized Waves, develop the so called Generalized Bidirectional Decomposition, and use it to obtain several luminal and superluminal (especially X-shaped) nondiffracting solutions of the wave equation. In section III we develop a space-time focusing method by a continuous superposition of X-Shaped pulses of different velocities. Section IV addresses the properties of chirped optical X-Shaped pulses propagating in material media without boundaries. Finally, in Section V, we show how a suitable superposition of Bessel beams can be used to obtain stationary localized wave fields, with a static envelope and a high transverse localization, and whose longitudinal intensity pattern can assume any desired shape within a chosen interval of the propagation axis.", "categories": ["physics.gen-ph", "physics.class-ph", "physics.optics"], "authors": ["Michel Zamboni-Rached", "Erasmo Recami", "Hugo E.

One way to deal with this problem is {\\em active} learning, where points to be labelled are selected with the aim of creating a model with better performance than that of an model trained on an equal number of randomly sampled points. In this paper, we instead propose to deal with the labelling cost directly: The learning goal is defined as the minimisation of a cost which is a function of the expected model performance and the total cost of the labels used. This allows the development of general strategies and specific algorithms for (a) optimal stopping, where the expected cost dictates whether label acquisition should continue (b) empirical evaluation, where the cost is used as a performance metric for a given combination of inference, stopping and sampling methods.

We study two distinct cases of causal inference: optimal causal filtering and optimal causal estimation.   Filtering corresponds to the ideal case in which the probability distribution of measurement sequences is known, giving a principled method to approximate a system's causal structure at a desired level of representation. We show that, in the limit in which a model complexity constraint is relaxed, filtering finds the exact causal architecture of a stochastic dynamical system, known as the causal-state partition. From this, one can estimate the amount of historical information the process stores. More generally, causal filtering finds a graded model-complexity hierarchy of approximations to the causal architecture. Abrupt changes in the hierarchy, as a function of approximation, capture distinct scales of structural organization.   For nonideal cases with finite data, we show how the correct number of underlying causal states can be found by optimal causal estimation.

We assumed that multimedia information representation which takes into account explicitly the users' needs and the cases of use could contribute to the adaptation potentials of the system for the end-users. We believe also that responses of multimedia information system would be more relevant to the users' needs if the types of results to be used from the system were identified before the design and development of the system. We propose the integration of the users' information needs. More precisely integrating usage contexts of resulting information in an information system (during creation and feedback) should enhance more pertinent users' need.

We then discuss a variety of fundamental issues that emerge in defining information and how one must exercise care in discussing concepts such as order, disorder, and incomplete knowledge. We also discuss an alternative form of entropy and its possible relevance for nonequilibrium thermodynamics.   In the final part of the paper we discuss how quantum mechanics gives rise to the very different concept of quantum information. Entirely new possibilities for information storage and computation are possible due to the massive parallel processing inherent in quantum mechanics. We also point out how entropy can be extended to apply to quantum mechanics to provide a useful measurement for quantum entanglement.

At any time, given some agent's current coding capabilities, part of the data is compressible by a short and hopefully fast program / description / explanation / world model. In the agent's subjective eyes, such data is more regular and more \"beautiful\" than other data. It is well-known that knowledge of regularity and repeatability may improve the agent's ability to plan actions leading to external rewards. In absence of such rewards, however, known beauty is boring. Then \"interestingness\" becomes the first derivative of subjective beauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly apparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful. Such progress in compressibility is measured and maximized by the curiosity drive: create action sequences that extend the observation history and yield previously unknown / unpredictable but quickly learnable algorithmic regularity. We discuss how all of the above can be naturally implemented on computers, through an extension of passive unsupervised learning to the case of active data selection: we reward a general reinforcement learner (with access to the adaptive compressor) for actions that improve the subjective compressibility of the growing data. An unusually large breakthrough in compressibility deserves the name \"discovery\".

The call-answer table is indexed on the call and a signature of the state in which the call was made. The answer columns contain the answer unification and a signature of the state after the call was executed. The states are signed efficiently using a technique based on tries and counting. The second method is based on incremental evaluation and it applies when the data oracle contains derived relations. The deletions and insertions (executed in the transaction oracle) change the state of the database. Using the heuristic of inertia (only a part of the state changes in response to elementary updates), most of the time it is cheaper to compute only the changes in the state than to recompute the entire state from scratch. The two methods are complementary by the fact that the first method optimizes the evaluation when a call is repeated in the same state, and the second method optimizes the evaluation of a new state when a call-state pair is not found by the tabling mechanism (i.e. the first method).

In this work, two possible enrichments (quantitative and/or qualitative) of linguistic labels are considered and operators (addition, multiplication, division, etc) for dealing with them are proposed and explained. We denote them $qe$-operators, $qe$ standing for \"qualitative-enriched\" operators. These operators can be seen as a direct extension of the classical qualitative operators ($q$-operators) proposed recently in the Dezert-Smarandache Theory of plausible and paradoxist reasoning (DSmT). $q$-operators are also justified in details in this paper.

In the second part of this paper we present a series of new SLSs to the Maxwell equations, suitable for arbitrary frequencies and arbitrary bandwidths: some of them being endowed with finite total energy. Among the others, we set forth an infinite family of generalizations of the classic X-shaped wave; and show how to deal with the case of a dispersive medium.

These new ideal subluminal solutions, which propagate without distortion in any homogeneous linear media, are herein obtained for arbitrarily chosen frequencies and bandwidths, avoiding in particular any recourse to the non-causal components so frequently plaguing the previously known localized waves. The new solutions are suitable superpositions of --zeroth-order, in general-- Bessel beams, which can be performed either by integrating with respect to (w.r.t.) the angular frequency, or by integrating w.r.t. the longitudinal wavenumber: Both methods are expounded in this paper. The first one appears to be powerful enough; we study the second method as well, however, since it allows dealing even with the limiting case of zero-speed solutions (and furnishes a new way, in terms of continuous spectra, for obtaining the so-called \"Frozen Waves\", so promising also from the point of view of applications). We briefly treat the case, moreover, of non-axially symmetric solutions, in terms of higher order Bessel beams.

Our main focus is on developing solutions for wireless users to successfully compete with each other for the limited and time-varying spectrum opportunities, given the experienced dynamics in the wireless network. We categorize these dynamics into two types: one is the disturbance due to the environment (e.g. wireless channel conditions, source traffic characteristics, etc.) and the other is the impact caused by competing users. To analyze the interactions among users given the environment disturbance, we propose a general stochastic framework for modeling how the competition among users for spectrum opportunities evolves over time. At each stage of the dynamic resource allocation, a central spectrum moderator auctions the available resources and the users strategically bid for the required resources. The joint bid actions affect the resource allocation and hence, the rewards and future strategies of all users. Based on the observed resource allocation and corresponding rewards from previous allocations, we propose a best response learning algorithm that can be deployed by wireless users to improve their bidding policy at each stage. The simulation results show that by deploying the proposed best response learning algorithm, the wireless users can significantly improve their own performance in terms of both the packet loss rate and the incurred cost for the used resources.", "categories": ["cs.lg", "cs.gt"], "authors": ["Fangwen Fu", "Mihaela van der Schaar"], "primary_category": "cs.lg", "published_date": "Sat, 15 Sep 2007 20:48:57 GMT", "updated_date": "Sat, 15 Sep 2007 20:48:57 GMT"}

Various other experimental results seem to point in the same direction: For instance, localized wavelet- type solutions to Maxwell equations have been found, both theoretically and experimentally, that travel with superluminal speed. [Even muonic and electronic neutrinos [it has been proposed] might be \"tachyons\", since their square mass appears to be negative]. With regard to the first-mentioned experiments, it was recently claimed by Guenter Nimtz that those results with evanescent waves (or tunneling photons) imply superluminal signal and impulse transmission, and therefore violate Einstein causality. In this note we want to stress that, on the contrary, all such results do not place relativistic causality in jeopardy, even if they referred to actual tachyonic motions: In fact, Special Relativity can cope even with superluminal objects and waves. For instance, it is possible (at least in microphysics) to solve also the known causal paradoxes, devised for faster than light motion, although this is not widely recognized yet. Here we show, in detail and rigorously, how to solve the oldest causal paradox, originally proposed by Tolman, which is the kernel of many further tachyon paradoxes (like J.Bell's, F.A.E.Pirani's, J.D.Edmonds' and others'). The key to the solution is a careful application of tachyon mechanics, as it unambiguously follows from special relativity. At Last, in one of the two Appendices, we propose how to evaluate the group-velocity in the case of evanescent waves.

There are two situations where such high dimensional features arise. One is when high dimensional measurements are available, for example, gene expression data produced by microarray techniques. For computational or other reasons, people may select only a small subset of features when modelling such data, by looking at how relevant the features are to predicting the response, based on some measure such as correlation with the response in the training data. Although it is used very commonly, this procedure will make the response appear more predictable than it actually is. In Chapter 2, we propose a Bayesian method to avoid this selection bias, with application to naive Bayes models and mixture models.   High dimensional features also arise when we consider high-order interactions. The number of parameters will increase exponentially with the order considered. In Chapter 3, we propose a method for compressing a group of parameters into a single one, by exploiting the fact that many predictor variables derived from high-order interactions have the same values for all the training cases. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before considering the highest possible order.

Based on such a representation, this paper further presents a supervised learning methodology of semantics associated to spatio-temporal patterns occurring in satellite image sequences. It enables the recognition and the probabilistic retrieval of similar events. Indeed, graphs are attached to statistical models for spatio-temporal processes, which at their turn describe physical changes in the observed scene. Therefore, we adjust a parametric model evaluating similarity types between graph patterns in order to represent user-specific semantics attached to spatio-temporal phenomena. The learning step is performed by the incremental definition of similarity types via user-provided spatio-temporal pattern examples attached to positive or/and negative semantics. From these examples, probabilities are inferred using a Bayesian network and a Dirichlet model. This enables to links user interest to a specific similarity model between graph patterns. According to the current state of learning, semantic posterior probabilities are updated for all possible graph patterns so that similar spatio-temporal phenomena can be recognized and retrieved from the image sequence.

The embedding optimally preserves the local functional coupling between fMRI time series and provides a low-dimensional coordinate system for detecting activated voxels. To compute the embedding, we build a graph of functionally connected voxels. We use the commute time, instead of the geodesic distance, to measure functional distances on the graph. Because the commute time can be computed directly from the eigenvectors of (a symmetric version) the graph probability transition matrix, we use these eigenvectors to embed the dataset in low dimensions. After clustering the datasets in low dimensions, coherent structures emerge that can be easily interpreted. We performed an extensive evaluation of our method comparing it to linear and nonlinear techniques using synthetic datasets and in vivo datasets. We analyzed datasets from the EBC competition obtained with subjects interacting in an urban virtual reality environment. Our exploratory approach is able to detect independently visual areas (V1/V2, V5/MT), auditory areas, and language areas.

In this paper, we suggest the use of the mutual information measure to select variables from the initial set. The mutual information measures the information content in input variables with respect to the model output, without making any assumption on the model that will be used; it is thus suitable for nonlinear modelling. In addition, it leads to the selection of variables among the initial set, and not to linear or nonlinear combinations of them.

Less known are the results of Rudolph and co-workers that DA also gives rise to a new pair of transforms - the similarity transform (S) that converts physical dimensional data into dimensionless space and its inverse (S'). Here, we present a new matrix generalisation of the Buckingham Theorem, made possible by recent developments in the theory of inverse non-square matrices, and show how the transform pair arises naturally. We demonstrate that the inverse transform S' is non-unique and how this casts doubt on scaling relations obtained in cases where observational data has not been referred to in order to break the degeneracy inherent in transforming back to dimensional (physical) space. As an example, we show how the underlying functional form of the Planck Radiation Law can be deduced in only a few lines using the matrix method and without appealing to first principles; thus demonstrating the possibility of a priori knowledge discovery; but that subsequent data analysis is still required in order to identify the exact causal law.

The number of variables hopefully can be reduced, by using either projection techniques or selection methods; the latter allow for the interpretation of the selected variables. Since the optimal approach of testing all possible subsets of variables with the prediction model is intractable, an incremental selection approach using a nonparametric statistics is a good option, as it avoids the computationally intensive use of the model itself. It has two drawbacks however: the number of groups of variables to test is still huge, and colinearities can make the results unstable. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a method to select groups of spectral variables. It consists in a forward-backward procedure applied to the coefficients of a B-Spline representation of the spectra. The criterion used in the forward-backward procedure is the mutual information, allowing to find nonlinear dependencies between variables, on the contrary of the generally used correlation. The spline representation is used to get interpretability of the results, as groups of consecutive spectral variables will be selected. The experiments conducted on NIR spectra from fescue grass and diesel fuels show that the method provides clearly identified groups of selected variables, making interpretation easy, while keeping a low computational load. The prediction performances obtained using the selected coefficients are higher than those obtained by the same method applied directly to the original variables and similar to those obtained using traditional models, although using significantly less spectral variables.", "categories": ["cs.lg", "stat.ap"], "authors": ["Fabrice Rossi (INRIA Rocquencourt / INRIA Sophia Antipolis)", "Damien\n  Fran\\c{c}ois (CESAME)", "Vincent Wertz (CESAME)", "Marc Meurens (BNUT)", "Michel\n  Verleysen (DICE - MLG)"], "primary_category": "cs.lg", "published_date": "Sun, 23 Sep 2007 14:08:51 GMT", "updated_date": "Sun, 23 Sep 2007 14:08:51 GMT"}

Their modal properties are full of relevant information concerning its dynamic behaviour in its elastic domain. The main scope of this paper is to determine relevant, though simple, beam modelling whose validity could be easily checked with experimental data. In this study, we recorded ambient vibrations in 3 buildings in Grenoble selected because of their vertical structural homogeneity. First, a set of recordings was done using a 18 channels digital acquisition system (CityShark) connected to six 3C Lennartz 5s sensors. We used the Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) technique to extract the modal parameters of these buildings. Second, it is shown in the following that the experimental quasi-elastic behaviour of such structure can be reduced to the behaviour of a vertical continuous Timoshenko beam. A parametric study of this beam shows that a bijective relation exists between the beam parameters and its eigenfrequencies distribution. Consequently, the Timoshenko beam parameters can be estimated from the experimental sequence of eigenfrequencies.

Every investment is evaluated in the market via a stylized return on investment function (RoI), which is modeled by a stochastic process with unknown periodicities and levels of noise. For comparison reasons, we present two reference strategies which represent the case of agents with zero-knowledge and complete-knowledge of the dynamics of the returns. We consider also an investment strategy based on technical analysis to forecast the next return by fitting a trend line to previous received returns. To account for the performance of the different strategies, we perform some computer experiments to calculate the average budget that can be obtained with them over a certain number of time steps. To assure for fair comparisons, we first tune the parameters of each strategy.

{"id": "0710.0013", "title": "Lagrangian Relaxation for MAP Estimation in Graphical Models", "abstract": "We develop a general framework for MAP estimation in discrete and Gaussian graphical models using Lagrangian relaxation techniques. The key idea is to reformulate an intractable estimation problem as one defined on a more tractable graph, but subject to additional constraints. Relaxing these constraints gives a tractable dual problem, one defined by a thin graph, which is then optimized by an iterative procedure. When this iterative optimization leads to a consistent estimate, one which also satisfies the constraints, then it corresponds to an optimal MAP estimate of the original model. Otherwise there is a ``duality gap'', and we obtain a bound on the optimal solution. Thus, our approach combines convex optimization with dynamic programming techniques applicable for thin graphs. The popular tree-reweighted max-product (TRMP) method may be seen as solving a particular class of such relaxations, where the intractable graph is relaxed to a set of spanning trees. We also consider relaxations to a set of small induced subgraphs, thin subgraphs (e.g. loops), and a connected tree obtained by ``unwinding'' cycles. In addition, we propose a new class of multiscale relaxations that introduce ``summary'' variables. The potential benefits of such generalizations include: reducing or eliminating the ``duality gap'' in hard problems, reducing the number or Lagrange multipliers in the dual problem, and accelerating convergence of the iterative optimization procedure.", "categories": ["cs.ai"], "authors": ["Jason K.

Their fundamental result is that the chordal graph in question is shown to be globally rigid, implying that exact inference provides the same matching solution as exact inference in a complete graphical model. This implies that the algorithm is optimal when there is no noise in the point patterns. In this paper, we present a new graph which is also globally rigid but has an advantage over the graph proposed in \\cite{CaeCaeSchBar06}: its maximal clique size is smaller, rendering inference significantly more efficient. However, our graph is not chordal and thus standard Junction Tree algorithms cannot be directly applied. Nevertheless, we show that loopy belief propagation in such a graph converges to the optimal solution. This allows us to retain the optimality guarantee in the noiseless case, while substantially reducing both memory requirements and processing time.

It is conclusive that flies could contribute a certain amount of neuromatrices indicating an imagery function of a visual-computational system into computer graphics and storage systems. The visual system involves the time aspect, whereas flies possess faster pulses compared to humans' visual ability due to the E-field state on an active fly's eye surface. This behaviour can be tested on a dissected fly specimen at its ommatidia. Electro-optical contacts and electrodes are wired through the flesh forming organic emitter layer to stimulate light emission, thereby to a computer circuit. The next step is applying a threshold voltage with secondary voltages to the circuit denoting an array of essential electrodes for bit switch. As a result, circuit's dormant pulses versus active pulses at the specimen's area are recorded. The outcome matrix possesses a construction of RGB and time radicals expressing the time problem in consumption, allocating time into computational algorithms, enhancing the technology far beyond. The obtained formulation generates consumed distance cons(x), denoting circuital travel between data source/sink for pixel data and bendable wavelengths.

Thus, in order to have an interpretable SVM classifier, it is important to respect the heredity principle when enforcing the sparsity in the SVM. Many variable selection methods, however, do not respect the heredity principle. In this paper we enforce both sparsity and the heredity principle in the SVM by using the so-called structured variable selection (SVS) framework originally proposed in Yuan, Joseph and Zou (2007). We minimize the empirical hinge loss under a set of linear inequality constraints and a lasso-type penalty. The solution always obeys the desired heredity principle and enjoys sparsity.

The main goals of this paper are to show how the modal analysis can contribute to the understanding of the seismic building response and the good relevancy of a modal model based on ambient vibrations for estimating the structural deformation under moderate earthquakes. We describe the application of an enhanced modal analysis technique (Frequency Domain Decomposition) to process ambient vibration recordings taken at the Grenoble City Hall building (France). The frequencies of ambient vibrations are compared with those of weak earthquakes recorded by the French permanent accelerometric network (RAP) that was installed to monitor the building. The frequency variations of the building under moderate earthquakes are shown to be slight (~2%) and therefore ambient vibration frequencies are relevant over the elastic domain of the building. The modal parameters extracted from ambient vibrations are then used to determine the 1D lumped-mass model in order to reproduce the inter-storey drift under weak earthquakes and to fix a 3D numerical model that could be used for strong earthquakes.

We find that the lensing features are qualitatively similar (though quantitatively different) for the Schwarzschild black holes, weakly naked, and marginally strongly naked singularities. However, the lensing characteristics of strongly naked singularities are qualitatively very different from those due the Schwarzschild black holes. The images produced by Schwarzschild black hole lenses and weakly naked and marginally strongly naked singularity lenses always have positive time delays. On the other hand, the strongly naked singularity lenses can give rise to images with positive, zero, or negative time delays. In particular, for a large angular source position the direct image (the outermost image on the same side as the source) due to strongly naked singularity lensing always has negative time delay. We also found that the scalar field decreases the time delay and increases the magnitude of magnifications of images; this result could have important implications for cosmology.

Each node in the network is located on a point in a two dimensional grid, and whenever a node sends a message, all awake nodes within distance r receive the message. In the broadcast problem, some node wants to successfully send a message to all other nodes in the network even when up to a 1/2 fraction of the nodes within every neighborhood can be deleted by an adversary. The set of deleted nodes is carefully chosen by the adversary to foil our algorithm and moreover, the set of deleted nodes may change periodically. This models worst-case behavior due to mobile nodes, static nodes losing power or simply some points in the grid being unoccupied. A trivial solution requires each node in the network to be awake roughly 1/2 the time, and a trivial lower bound shows that each node must be awake for at least a 1/n fraction of the time. Our first result is an algorithm that requires each node to be awake for only a 1/sqrt(n) fraction of the time in expectation. Our algorithm achieves this while ensuring correctness with probability 1, and keeping optimal values for other resource costs such as latency and number of messages sent. We give a lower-bound that shows that this reduction in power consumption is asymptotically optimal when latency and number of messages sent must be optimal. If we can increase the latency and messages sent by only a log*n factor we give a Las Vegas algorithm that requires each node to be awake for only a (log*n)/n expected fraction of the time; we give a lower-bound showing that this second algorithm is near optimal.

In addition, when the top $k$ ranked elements only are required ($k \\ll n$), as in many applications in information extraction or search engines, the time complexity of our algorithm can be further reduced to $O(k \\log k + n)$. Our reduction and algorithm are thus practical for realistic applications where the number of points to rank exceeds several thousands.

The general formulation is based on the requirements that the cloaking occurs for all possible incident fields and that the cloaks with frequency w > 0 have continuous tangential E and H fields across their outer surfaces, and zero normal D and B fields at their inner material surfaces. The tangential-field boundary conditions at the outer surface of the cloak ensure zero scattered fields, and the normal-field boundary conditions at the inner surface of the cloak are compatible with zero total fields inside the interior cavity of the cloak. For spherical cloaks, unlike cylindrical cloaks, these boundary conditions lead to all the tangential components of the E and H fields being continuously zero across their inner surfaces -- cylindrical cloaks having delta functions in polarization densities at their inner surfaces. For bodies with no interior free-space cavities, the formulation is used to derive nonscattering spherical and cylindrical concentrators that magnify the incident fields near their centers. For static fields (w = 0), the boundary value formulation is appropriately modified to obtain a permeability dyadic that will cloak magnetostatic fields.

In contrast with some alternatives, the presented formulation can also be easily extended to accommodate complex performance indicators (``soft constraints'') imposed in a number of real-life course timetabling applications. Its performance depends on the quality of the clique partition, but encouraging empirical results for the Udine Course Timetabling problem are reported.", "categories": ["cs.dm", "cs.ds", "math.co"], "authors": ["Edmund K.

The heuristics used in dynamic compilation are highly constrained by limited resources, time and memory in particular. Recent results on the SSA form open promising directions for the design of new register allocation heuristics for embedded systems and especially for embedded compilation. In particular, heuristics based on tree scan with two separated phases -- one for spilling, then one for coloring/coalescing -- seem good candidates for designing memory-friendly, fast, and competitive register allocators. Still, also because of the side effect on power consumption, the minimization of loads and stores overhead (spilling problem) is an important issue. This paper provides an exhaustive study of the complexity of the ``spill everywhere'' problem in the context of the SSA form. Unfortunately, conversely to our initial hopes, many of the questions we raised lead to NP-completeness results. We identify some polynomial cases but that are impractical in JIT context.

Our scheme does \\emph{not} rely on a subset of \\emph{trusted} nodes that are not allowed to misbehave and are known to every node in the network. Thus, any subset of nodes is allowed to try faking its position. As in previous approaches, our protocol is based on distance evaluation techniques developed for WSN. On the positive side, we show that when the received signal strength (RSS) technique is used, our protocol handles at most $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor-2$ faking sensors. Also, when the time of flight (ToF) technique is used, our protocol manages at most $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor - 3$ misbehaving sensors.

The coarsest level of blocking replaces GCD computations by multiplications, as suggested by Pollard (1975), von zur Gathen and Shoup (1992), and others. The novelty of our approach is that a finer level of blocking replaces multiplications by squarings, which speeds up the computation in GF(2)[x]/P(x) of certain interval polynomials when P(x) is sparse. As an application we give a fast algorithm to search for all irreducible trinomials x^r + x^s + 1 of degree r over GF(2), while producing a certificate that can be checked in less time than the full search. Naive algorithms cost O(r^2) per trinomial, thus O(r^3) to search over all trinomials of given degree r. Under a plausible assumption about the distribution of factors of trinomials, the new algorithm has complexity O(r^2 (log r)^{3/2}(log log r)^{1/2}) for the search over all trinomials of degree r. Our implementation achieves a speedup of greater than a factor of 560 over the naive algorithm in the case r = 24036583 (a Mersenne exponent).

The choice of laser speckle as a source of random keys is quite natural, given the chaotic properties of speckle. However, this same chaotic behaviour also causes reproducibility problems. Cryptographic protocols require either zero noise or very low noise in their inputs; hence the issue of error rates is critical to applications of laser speckle in cryptography. Most of the literature uses an error reduction method based on Gabor filtering. Though the method is successful, it has not been thoroughly analysed.   In this paper we present a statistical analysis of Gabor-filtered speckle patterns. We introduce a model in which perturbations are described as random phase changes in the source plane. Using this model we compute the second and fourth order statistics of Gabor coefficients.

Those relations connect the messages that are found in the documents, resulting thus in a graph which we call grid.

However, for a certain type of (sufficiently) good codes an efficient decoding algorithm with near optimal performance exists. These codes are defined via a combination of constituent codes with low complexity trellis representations. Their decoding algorithm is an instance of (loopy) belief propagation and is based on an iterative transfer of constituent beliefs. The beliefs are thereby given by the symbol probabilities computed in the constituent trellises. Even though weak constituent codes are employed close to optimal performance is obtained, i.e., the encoder/decoder pair (almost) achieves the information theoretic capacity. However, (loopy) belief propagation only performs well for a rather specific set of codes, which limits its applicability.   In this paper a generalisation of iterative decoding is presented. It is proposed to transfer more values than just the constituent beliefs. This is achieved by the transfer of beliefs obtained by independently investigating parts of the code space. This leads to the concept of discriminators, which are used to improve the decoder resolution within certain areas and defines discriminated symbol beliefs. It is shown that these beliefs approximate the overall symbol probabilities. This leads to an iteration rule that (below channel capacity) typically only admits the solution of the overall decoding problem.

As a frustrated assembly of interacting bodies, such a material evolves from one conformation to another through a succession of discrete, topological events driven by finite external forces. As a result, the material exhibits a finite yield threshold. The individual objects usually evolve spontaneously (colloidal diffusion, object coalescence, molecular diffusion), and the material properties under low or vanishing stress may alter with time, a phenomenon known as aging. We neglect such effects to address the simpler behaviour of (uncommon) immortal fluids: we construct a minimal, fully tensorial, rheological model, equivalent to the (scalar) Bingham model. Importantly, the model consistently describes the ability of such soft materials to deform substantially in the elastic regime (be it compressible or not) before they undergo (incompressible) plastic creep -- or viscous flow under even higher stresses.", "categories": ["cond-mat.soft", "physics.class-ph"], "authors": ["Sylvain B\\'enito (INRIA Futurs", "MAB)", "Charles-Henri Bruneau (INRIA\n  Futurs", "MAB)", "Thierry Colin (INRIA Futurs", "MAB)", "Cyprien Gay (CRPP", "MSC)", "Fran\\c{c}ois Molino (CRPP", "IGF)"], "primary_category": "cond-mat.soft", "published_date": "Fri, 2 Nov 2007 20:15:51 GMT", "updated_date": "Fri, 2 Nov 2007 20:15:51 GMT"}

The system is examined at successive orders of approximation, each of which corresponding to a physical time scale. The multicomponent Navier-Stokes regime is reached for the heavy particles, which follow a hyperbolic scaling, and is coupled to first order drift-diffusion equations for the electrons, which follow a parabolic scaling. The transport coefficients exhibit an anisotropic behavior when the magnetic field is strong enough.

To this aim an ad-hoc mark-up language for this layer is currently under discussion. It is intended to follow the tradition of hybrid knowledge representation and reasoning systems such as $\\mathcal{AL}$-log that integrates the description logic $\\mathcal{ALC}$ and the function-free Horn clausal language \\textsc{Datalog}. In this paper we consider the problem of automating the acquisition of these rules for the Semantic Web. We propose a general framework for rule induction that adopts the methodological apparatus of Inductive Logic Programming and relies on the expressive and deductive power of $\\mathcal{AL}$-log. The framework is valid whatever the scope of induction (description vs. prediction) is. Yet, for illustrative purposes, we also discuss an instantiation of the framework which aims at description and turns out to be useful in Ontology Refinement.

SVD is a powerful tool that has achieved impressive results in information retrieval, collaborative filtering, computational linguistics, computational vision, and other fields. However, SVD is limited to two-dimensional arrays of data (two modes), and many potential applications have three or more modes, which require higher-order tensor decompositions. This paper evaluates four algorithms for higher-order tensor decomposition: Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HO-SVD), Higher-Order Orthogonal Iteration (HOOI), Slice Projection (SP), and Multislice Projection (MP). We measure the time (elapsed run time), space (RAM and disk space requirements), and fit (tensor reconstruction accuracy) of the four algorithms, under a variety of conditions. We find that standard implementations of HO-SVD and HOOI do not scale up to larger tensors, due to increasing RAM requirements.

Samples of the plenoptic function (POF) are seen in video and in general visual content, and represent large amounts of information. In this paper we propose a stochastic model to study the compression limits of the plenoptic function. In the proposed framework, we isolate the two fundamental sources of information in the POF: the one representing the camera motion and the other representing the information complexity of the \"reality\" being acquired and transmitted. The sources of information are combined, generating a stochastic process that we study in detail. We first propose a model for ensembles of realities that do not change over time. The proposed model is simple in that it enables us to derive precise coding bounds in the information-theoretic sense that are sharp in a number of cases of practical interest. For this simple case of static realities and camera motion, our results indicate that coding practice is in accordance with optimal coding from an information-theoretic standpoint. The model is further extended to account for visual realities that change over time. We derive bounds on the lossless and lossy information rates for this dynamic reality model, stating conditions under which the bounds are tight.

This conceptual shift directs us toward the evolution of compact populations containing only a handful of members. We find that the resulting algorithm can search the design space more efficiently than traditional GA strategies due to its ability to exploit mutations within this compact self-organizing population.

We show then that the optimal outcomes of a CP-net are exactly the Nash equilibria of such games. This allows us to use the techniques of game theory to search for optimal outcomes of CP-nets and vice-versa, to use techniques developed for CP-nets to search for Nash equilibria of the considered games. Then, we relate the notion of optimality used in the area of soft constraints to that used in a generalization of strategic games, called graphical games. In particular we prove that for a natural class of soft constraints that includes weighted constraints every optimal solution is both a Nash equilibrium and Pareto efficient joint strategy.

Anomalies that have been observed before, like time inconsistency, can be understood as arising important because different games are being played, against bookies with different information. We characterize the important special cases in which the optimal decision rules according to the minimax criterion amount to either conditioning or simply ignoring the information.

The overall approach learns by building a probabilistic model, i.e. an estimation of the probability distribution of individual nurse-rule pairs that are used to construct schedules. The local search processor (i.e. the ant-miner) reinforces nurse-rule pairs that receive higher rewards. A challenging real world nurse rostering problem is used as the test problem.

In its ultimate generality, the restless bandit problem is known to be PSPACE-Hard to approximate to any non-trivial factor, and little progress has been made despite its importance in modeling activity allocation under uncertainty.   We consider a special case that we call Feedback MAB, where the reward obtained by playing each of n independent arms varies according to an underlying on/off Markov process whose exact state is only revealed when the arm is played. The goal is to design a policy for playing the arms in order to maximize the infinite horizon time average expected reward. This problem is also an instance of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and is widely studied in wireless scheduling and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) routing. Unlike the stochastic MAB problem, the Feedback MAB problem does not admit to greedy index-based optimal policies.   We develop a novel and general duality-based algorithmic technique that yields a surprisingly simple and intuitive 2+epsilon-approximate greedy policy to this problem. We then define a general sub-class of restless bandit problems that we term Monotone bandits, for which our policy is a 2-approximation. Our technique is robust enough to handle generalizations of these problems to incorporate various side-constraints such as blocking plays and switching costs. This technique is also of independent interest for other restless bandit problems.

As $U$ is reduced, the steady catenary thread bifurcates into a meandering state in which the thread displacements are only transverse to the motion of the belt. We measured the amplitude and frequency $\\omega$ of the meandering close to the bifurcation. For smaller $U$, single-frequency meandering bifurcates to a two-frequency \"figure eight\" state, which contains a significant $2\\omega$ component and parallel as well as transverse displacements. This eventually reverts to single-frequency coiling at still smaller $U$. More complex, highly hysteretic states with additional frequencies are observed for larger nozzle heights.

The main new ingredient in our approach is a lemma that shows that given a locally optimal out-branching of a directed graph in which every arc is part of at least one out-branching, either an out-branching with at least k leaves exists, or a path decomposition with width O(k^3) can be found. This enables a dynamic programming based algorithm of running time 2^{O(k^3 \\log k)} n^{O(1)}, where n=|V(D)|.", "categories": ["cs.ds", "cs.dm"], "authors": ["Paul Bonsma", "Frederic Dorn"], "primary_category": "cs.ds", "published_date": "Mon, 26 Nov 2007 17:05:38 GMT", "updated_date": "Mon, 26 Nov 2007 17:05:38 GMT"}

It allows a representation of a general class of objects including geometric patterns and images in a sparse, modular, hierarchical, and recursive manner. The representation can exploit any computable regularity in objects to compactly describe them, while also being capable of representing random objects as raw data. A set of rules uniformly dictates the interpretation of the representation into raw signal, which makes it possible to ask what pattern a given raw signal contains. Also, it allows simple separation of the information that we wish to ignore from that which we measure, by using a set of maps to delineate the a priori parts of the objects, leaving only the information in the structure.   Using the representation, we introduce a measure of information in general objects relative to structures defined by the set of maps. We point out that the common prescription of encoding objects by strings to use Kolmogorov complexity is meaningless when, as often is the case, the encoding is not specified in any way other than that it exists. Noting this, we define the measure directly in terms of the structures of the spaces in which the objects reside. As a result, the measure is defined relative to a set of maps that characterize the structures. It turns out that the measure is equivalent to Kolmogorov complexity when it is defined relative to the maps characterizing the structure of natural numbers. Thus, the formulation gives the larger class of objects a meaningful measure of information that generalizes Kolmogorov complexity.", "categories": ["cs.cc", "cs.cv", "cs.it", "math.it"], "authors": ["Hiroshi Ishikawa"], "primary_category": "cs.cc", "published_date": "Wed, 28 Nov 2007 18:41:30 GMT", "updated_date": "Thu, 12 Jun 2008 03:37:52 GMT"}

Our method uses a single ``compressed'' parameter to represent the sum of all parameters associated with a set of patterns that have the same value for all training cases. Using symmetric stable distributions as the priors of the original parameters, we can easily find the priors of these compressed parameters. We therefore need to deal only with a much smaller number of compressed parameters when training the model with MCMC. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before considering the highest possible order. After training the model, we can split these compressed parameters into the original ones as needed to make predictions for test cases.

{"id": "0712.0136", "title": "Learning View Generalization Functions", "abstract": "Learning object models from views in 3D visual object recognition is usually formulated either as a function approximation problem of a function describing the view-manifold of an object, or as that of learning a class-conditional density. This paper describes an alternative framework for learning in visual object recognition, that of learning the view-generalization function. Using the view-generalization function, an observer can perform Bayes-optimal 3D object recognition given one or more 2D training views directly, without the need for a separate model acquisition step. The paper shows that view generalization functions can be computationally practical by restating two widely-used methods, the eigenspace and linear combination of views approaches, in a view generalization framework. The paper relates the approach to recent methods for object recognition based on non-uniform blurring. The paper presents results both on simulated 3D ``paperclip'' objects and real-world images from the COIL-100 database showing that useful view-generalization functions can be realistically be learned from a comparatively small number of training examples.", "categories": ["cs.cv"], "authors": ["Thomas M.

We then discuss relative bounds, comparing the generalization error of two classification rules, showing how the margin assumption of Mammen and Tsybakov can be replaced with some empirical measure of the covariance structure of the classification model.We show how to associate to any posterior distribution an effective temperature relating it to the Gibbs prior distribution with the same level of expected error rate, and how to estimate this effective temperature from data, resulting in an estimator whose expected error rate converges according to the best possible power of the sample size adaptively under any margin and parametric complexity assumptions. We describe and study an alternative selection scheme based on relative bounds between estimators, and present a two step localization technique which can handle the selection of a parametric model from a family of those. We show how to extend systematically all the results obtained in the inductive setting to transductive learning, and use this to improve Vapnik's generalization bounds, extending them to the case when the sample is made of independent non-identically distributed pairs of patterns and labels.

This is due to the fact that equivalence for substitution (known as strong equivalence) and ordinary equivalence are different concepts. The former holds, given programs P and Q, iff P can be faithfully replaced by Q within any context R, while the latter holds iff P and Q provide the same output, that is, they have the same answer sets. Notions in between strong and ordinary equivalence have been introduced as theoretical tools to compare incomplete programs and are defined by either restricting the syntactic structure of the considered context programs R or by bounding the set A of atoms allowed to occur in R (relativized equivalence).For the latter approach, different A yield properly different equivalence notions, in general. For the former approach, however, it turned out that any ``reasonable'' syntactic restriction to R coincides with either ordinary, strong, or uniform equivalence. In this paper, we propose a parameterization for equivalence notions which takes care of both such kinds of restrictions simultaneously by bounding, on the one hand, the atoms which are allowed to occur in the rule heads of the context and, on the other hand, the atoms which are allowed to occur in the rule bodies of the context.

However, these algorithms do not scale in practice. This paper analyzes existing MaxSAT algorithms based on unsatisfiable subformula identification. Moreover, the paper proposes a number of key optimizations to these MaxSAT algorithms and a new alternative algorithm. The proposed optimizations and the new algorithm provide significant performance improvements on MaxSAT instances from practical applications. Moreover, the efficiency of the new generation of unsatisfiability-based MaxSAT solvers becomes effectively indexed to the ability of modern SAT solvers to proving unsatisfiability and identifying unsatisfiable subformulas.", "categories": ["cs.ai", "cs.ds"], "authors": ["Joao Marques-Silva", "Jordi Planes"], "primary_category": "cs.ai", "published_date": "Fri, 7 Dec 2007 09:21:58 GMT", "updated_date": "Fri, 7 Dec 2007 09:21:58 GMT"}

The essential idea is to prevent the premature condensation into few large communities. Upon convergence of the MSG a simple refinement procedure called \"vertex mover\" (VM) is used for reassigning vertices to neighboring communities to improve the final modularity value.

One approach towards illuminating the connection between fMRI and cognitive function is through decoding; how do the time series of voxel activities combine to provide information about internal and external experience? Here we seek models of fMRI decoding which are balanced between the simplicity of their interpretation and the effectiveness of their prediction. We use signals from a subject immersed in virtual reality to compare global and local methods of prediction applying both linear and nonlinear techniques of dimensionality reduction. We find that the prediction of complex stimuli is remarkably low-dimensional, saturating with less than 100 features. In particular, we build effective models based on the decorrelated components of cognitive activity in the classically-defined Brodmann areas. For some of the stimuli, the top predictive areas were surprisingly transparent, including Wernicke's area for verbal instructions, visual cortex for facial and body features, and visual-temporal regions for velocity. Direct sensory experience resulted in the most robust predictions, with the highest correlation ($c \\sim 0.8$) between the predicted and experienced time series of verbal instructions. Techniques based on non-linear dimensionality reduction (Laplacian eigenmaps) performed similarly.

Formulas in CL stand for (interactive) computational problems, understood as games between a machine and its environment; logical operators represent operations on such entities; and \"truth\" is understood as existence of an effective solution, i.e., of an algorithmic winning strategy.   The formalism of CL is open-ended, and may undergo series of extensions as the study of the subject advances. The main groups of operators on which CL has been focused so far are the parallel, choice, branching, and blind operators. The present paper introduces a new important group of operators, called sequential. The latter come in the form of sequential conjunction and disjunction, sequential quantifiers, and sequential recurrences. As the name may suggest, the algorithmic intuitions associated with this group are those of sequential computations, as opposed to the intuitions of parallel computations associated with the parallel group of operations: playing a sequential combination of games means playing its components in a sequential fashion, one after one.   The main technical result of the present paper is a sound and complete axiomatization of the propositional fragment of computability logic whose vocabulary, together with negation, includes all three -- parallel, choice and sequential -- sorts of conjunction and disjunction.

This paper presents a new theoretic foundation for cross-layer optimization, which allows each layer to make autonomous decisions individually, while maximizing the utility of the wireless user by optimally determining what information needs to be exchanged among layers. Hence, this cross-layer framework does not change the current layered architecture. Specifically, because the wireless user interacts with the environment at various layers of the protocol stack, the cross-layer optimization problem is formulated as a layered Markov decision process (MDP) in which each layer adapts its own protocol parameters and exchanges information (messages) with other layers in order to cooperatively maximize the performance of the wireless user. The message exchange mechanism for determining the optimal cross-layer transmission strategies has been designed for both off-line optimization and on-line dynamic adaptation.

For the cross-stream scalar flux, in the inertial range the spectral behavior agrees with classical predictions and measurements. The streamwise scalar flux is found to be in good agreement with the results of atmospheric measurements. However, both the model results and the atmospheric measurements disagree with classical predictions. A detailed analysis of the different terms in the evolution equation for the streamwise scalar flux spectrum shows that nonlinear contributions are governing the inertial subrange of this spectrum and that these contributions are relatively more important than for the cross-stream flux. A new expression for the scalar flux spectra is proposed. It allows us to unify the description of the components in one single expression, leading to a classical K^-7/3 inertial range for the cross-stream component and to a new K^-23/9 scaling for the streamwise component that agrees better with atmospheric measurements than the K^-3 prediction of J.

In contrast to other models, the mechanism depends neither on the nature (light or matter) of the beams (continuous waves or pulses) nor on material and shape of the multiple-beam source (arrays of 1-D and 2-D subwavelength apertures, fibers, dipoles or atoms).

The \\textit{density} $d$ of an SSP instance is defined by the ratio of $n$ to $m$, where $m$ is the logarithm of the largest integer within $A$. Based on the structural and statistical properties of subset sums, we present an improved enumeration scheme for SSP, and implement it as a complete and exact algorithm (EnumPlus). The algorithm always equivalently reduces an instance to be low-density, and then solve it by enumeration. Through this approach, we show the possibility to design a sole algorithm that can efficiently solve arbitrary density instance in a uniform way. Furthermore, our algorithm has considerable performance advantage over previous algorithms. Firstly, it extends the density scope, in which SSP can be solved in expected polynomial time. Specifically, It solves SSP in expected $O(n\\log{n})$ time when density $d \\geq c\\cdot \\sqrt{n}/\\log{n}$, while the previously best density scope is $d \\geq c\\cdot n/(\\log{n})^{2}$. In addition, the overall expected time and space requirement in the average case are proven to be $O(n^5\\log n)$ and $O(n^5)$ respectively. Secondly, in the worst case, it slightly improves the previously best time complexity of exact algorithms for SSP.

Our analysis reveals intimate connections between length contraction and the dynamics of internal forces within the accelerated system.   The developed approach is used to analyze the correlation between two congruent disks - one stationary and one rotating (the Ehrenfest paradox).

For a general graphical model on a loopy graph the functional may show multiple minima, the iterative BP algorithm may converge to one of the minima or may not converge at all, and the global minimum of the Bethe free energy functional is not guaranteed to correspond to the optimal Maximum-Likelihood (ML) solution in the zero-temperature limit. However, there are exceptions to this general rule, discussed in \\cite{05KW} and \\cite{08BSS} in two different contexts, where zero-temperature version of the BP algorithm finds ML solution for special models on graphs with loops. These two models share a key feature: their ML solutions can be found by an efficient Linear Programming (LP) algorithm with a Totally-Uni-Modular (TUM) matrix of constraints. Generalizing the two models we consider a class of graphical models reducible in the zero temperature limit to LP with TUM constraints. Assuming that a gedanken algorithm, g-BP, funding the global minimum of the Bethe free energy is available we show that in the limit of zero temperature g-BP outputs the ML solution.

In this paper, we look at these functions from the complementary side: information. We use a recent toolbox built on top of a vast class of distortions coined by Bregman, whose application field rivals metrics' in various subfields of mathematics. This toolbox makes it possible to find the quality of an aggregator (for consumptions, prices, labor, capital, wages, etc.), from the standpoint of the information it carries. We prove a rather striking result.   From the informational standpoint, well-known economic aggregators do belong to the \\textit{optimal} set. As common economic assumptions enter the analysis, this large set shrinks, and it essentially ends up \\textit{exactly fitting} either CES, or Cobb-Douglas, or both. To summarize, in the relevant economic contexts, one could not have crafted better some aggregator from the information standpoint.

We argue that multi-grain models are more appropriate for our task since standard models tend to produce topics that correspond to global properties of objects (e.g., the brand of a product type) rather than the aspects of an object that tend to be rated by a user. The models we present not only extract ratable aspects, but also cluster them into coherent topics, e.g., `waitress' and `bartender' are part of the same topic `staff' for restaurants.

We have to bear in mind that writing documents is the concern of textual linguistics, of which one of the principles is the incompleteness of text, whereas building ontology - viewed as task-independent knowledge - is concerned with conceptualization based on formal and not natural languages. Nevertheless, the famous Sapir and Whorf hypothesis, concerning the interdependence of thought and language, is also applicable to formal languages.

Such a coupling of biological and linguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a small change of the model control parameter a poorly communicating group of linguistically unskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating group with large learning abilities. Genetic imprinting of the learning abilities proceeds via Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents learn a language and that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary pressure for the increase of learning ability. Under the assumption that communication intensity increases continuously with finite speed, the transition is split into several transition-like changes. It shows that the speed of cultural changes, that sets an additional characteristic timescale, might be yet another factor affecting the evolution of language.

The reflectance spectra of two-dimensional square and triangular lattices are obtained by means of the vector Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method, both spectra showing very similar qualitative features for photon energies below the onset of diffraction spots. In this energy region, the same number of peaks of unitary amplitude in the reflectance spectra are predicted for both kinds of monolayers, suggesting that this must be a universal feature independent of the particular geometry of the lattice. The origin of these high reflectance peaks is investigated.

We give a truthful mechanism under the utility model where bidders try to maximize their clicks, subject to their personal constraints. In addition, we show that the revenue-maximizing mechanism is not truthful, but has a Nash equilibrium whose outcome is identical to our mechanism. As far as we can tell, this is the first treatment of sponsored search that directly incorporates both multiple slots and budget constraints into an analysis of incentives.   Our mechanism employs a descending-price auction that maintains a solution to a certain machine scheduling problem whose job lengths depend on the price, and hence is variable over the auction. The price stops when the set of bidders that can afford that price pack exactly into a block of ad slots, at which point the mechanism allocates that block and continues on the remaining slots. To prove our result on the equilibrium of the revenue-maximizing mechanism, we first show that a greedy algorithm suffices to solve the revenue-maximizing linear program; we then use this insight to prove that bidders allocated in the same block of our mechanism have no incentive to deviate from bidding the fixed price of that block.", "categories": ["cs.gt", "cs.ds"], "authors": ["Jon Feldman", "S.

We therefore construct an approximation of the concave problem solution by following a solution path of a convex-concave problem obtained by linear interpolation of the convex and concave formulations, starting from the convex relaxation. This method allows to easily integrate the information on graph label similarities into the optimization problem, and therefore to perform labeled weighted graph matching.

DASH is fully distributed; adds new edges only among neighbors of deleted nodes; and has average latency and bandwidth costs that are at most logarithmic in n. DASH has these properties irrespective of the topology of the initial network, and is thus orthogonal and complementary to traditional topology-based approaches to defending against attack.   We also prove lower-bounds showing that DASH is asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing maximum degree increase over multiple attacks. Finally, we present empirical results on power-law graphs that show that DASH performs well in practice, and that it significantly outperforms naive algorithms in reducing maximum degree increase.

Divergences and mode couplings have thus been underscored within the rotating frame and in order to simplify understanding of all these phenomena, the dofs of the beams will first be treated separately and then together. The dynamics of radial rotating loads on an elastic ring can create divergence instabilities as well as post-critical mode couplings. Moreover, the flexural motion of beam rubbing on the ring can also lead to mode couplings and to the locus-veering phenomenon. The presence of rubbing seems to make the system unstable as soon as the rotational speed of the beams is greater than zero.

Most materials are classified as simple materials; i.e., their electrical properties are linear, isotropic and homogeneous. Charge transport in these simple materials should be described by a constitutive equation known as Ohm's law. When Ohm's law is combined with Gauss' law and the equation of continuity, a differential equation for volume charge density relaxation results. The usual solution to this equation shows that charge decays exponentially with a relaxation time given by the material's permittivity divided by its electrical conductivity. Experiments show that good conductors follow this exponential decay but that poor conductors (insulators) tend to follow a decay that initially is more hyperbolic than exponential. This suggests that either Ohm's law is not valid for insulator materials or that a deeper understanding of Ohm's law is needed to explain charge decay in these less than good conductors. This paper examines the latter approach and shows that, when all the free charges within a simple material are taken into account, a new unipolar charge decay equation is derived which is valid for any simple material: conductor, insulator or anywhere in between. For good conductors the equation reduces to the standard exponential law of decay. For very poor conductors it reduces to the Vellenga-Klinkenberg modified hyperbolic law with the initial decay producing the characteristic Bustin hyperbolic law of decay.

{"id": "0801.4238", "title": "Algorithms for Temperature-Aware Task Scheduling in Microprocessor   Systems", "abstract": "We study scheduling problems motivated by recently developed techniques for microprocessor thermal management at the operating systems level. The general scenario can be described as follows. The microprocessor's temperature is controlled by the hardware thermal management system that continuously monitors the chip temperature and automatically reduces the processor's speed as soon as the thermal threshold is exceeded. Some tasks are more CPU-intensive than other and thus generate more heat during execution. The cooling system operates non-stop, reducing (at an exponential rate) the deviation of the processor's temperature from the ambient temperature. As a result, the processor's temperature, and thus the performance as well, depends on the order of the task execution. Given a variety of possible underlying architectures, models for cooling and for hardware thermal management, as well as types of tasks, this scenario gives rise to a plethora of interesting and never studied scheduling problems.   We focus on scheduling real-time jobs in a simplified model for cooling and thermal management. A collection of unit-length jobs is given, each job specified by its release time, deadline and heat contribution. If, at some time step, the temperature of the system is t and the processor executes a job with heat contribution h, then the temperature at the next step is (t+h)/2. The temperature cannot exceed the given thermal threshold T. The objective is to maximize the throughput, that is, the number of tasks that meet their deadlines. We prove that, in the offline case, computing the optimum schedule is NP-hard, even if all jobs are released at the same time. In the online case, we show a 2-competitive deterministic algorithm and a matching lower bound.", "categories": ["cs.ds"], "authors": ["Marek Chrobak", "Christoph Durr", "Mathilde Hurand", "Julien Robert"], "primary_category": "cs.ds", "published_date": "Mon, 28 Jan 2008 10:47:42 GMT", "updated_date": "Mon, 28 Jan 2008 10:47:42 GMT"}

According to Kraichnan's 1962 prediction, the flow boundary layers above the cold and hot plates -in which most of the fluid temperature drop is localized- become unstable for large enough $Ra$ and this instability boosts the heat transport compared to the other turbulent regimes. Using the same convection cell as in the 1997 experiment, we show that the reported heat transport increase is accompanied with enhanced temperature fluctuations of the bottom plate, which was heated at constant power levels. Indeed, for $Ra < 10^{12}$, the bottom plate fluctuations can simply be accounted from those in the bulk of the flow. In particular, they share the same spectral density at low frequencies, as if the bottom plate was following the slow temperature fluctuations of the bulk, modulo a constant temperature drop across the bottom boundary layer. Conversely, to account for the plate's temperature fluctuations at higher $Ra$, we no-longuer can ignore the fluctuations of the temperature drop across the boundary layer. The negative skewness of fluctuations at high $Ra$ supports the picture of a boundary layer instability. These observations provide new evidence that the transition reported in 1997 corresponds to the triggering of the Ultimate Regime of convection.", "categories": ["cond-mat.other", "physics.class-ph", "physics.flu-dyn"], "authors": ["Fr\\'ed\\'eric Gauthier (NEEL)", "Philippe-Emmanuel P.-E.

The inertial property of matter is then discussed in terms of a kind of induction law related to the extended charged particle's own vector potential. Moreover, it is obtained a force term that represents a drag force acting on the charged particle when in motion relatively to its own vector potential field lines. The time rate of variation of the particle's vector potential leads to the acceleration inertia reaction force, equivalent to the Schott term responsible for the source of the radiation field. We also show that the velocity dependent term of the particle's vector potential is connected with the relativistic increase of mass with velocity and generates a longitudinal stress force that is the source of electric field lines deformation.

An original feature of the formulation is that the bounding surface is considered independently of the surface of ultimate loads of the system. The second mechanism is the detachment that can take place at the soil-footing interface (foundation uplift).

Considering a particular (though simple) regression problem, we prove that VFCV with a bounded V is suboptimal for model selection, because it ``overpenalizes'' all the more that V is large. Hence, asymptotic optimality requires V to go to infinity. However, when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, it appears that overpenalizing is necessary, so that the optimal V is not always the larger one, despite of the variability issue. This is confirmed by some simulated data. In order to improve on the prediction performance of VFCV, we define a new model selection procedure, called ``V-fold penalization'' (penVF). It is a V-fold subsampling version of Efron's bootstrap penalties, so that it has the same computational cost as VFCV, while being more flexible. In a heteroscedastic regression framework, assuming the models to have a particular structure, we prove that penVF satisfies a non-asymptotic oracle inequality with a leading constant that tends to 1 when the sample size goes to infinity. In particular, this implies adaptivity to the smoothness of the regression function, even with a highly heteroscedastic noise. Moreover, it is easy to overpenalize with penVF, independently from the V parameter. A simulation study shows that this results in a significant improvement on VFCV in non-asymptotic situations.", "categories": ["math.st", "stat.ml", "stat.th"], "authors": ["Sylvain Arlot (LM-Orsay", "INRIA Futurs)"], "primary_category": "math.st", "published_date": "Tue, 5 Feb 2008 08:56:27 GMT", "updated_date": "Thu, 7 Feb 2008 11:34:45 GMT"}

Tests were performed at total suctions ranging from 9 to 110 MPa, temperature from 25 to 80 degrees C, isotropic pressure from 0.1 to 60 MPa. It was observed that heating at constant suction and pressure induces either swelling or contraction. The results from compression tests at constant suction and temperature evidenced that at lower suction, the yield pressure was lower, the elastic compressibility parameter and the plastic compressibility parameter were higher. On the other hand, at a similar suction, the yield pressure was slightly influenced by the temperature; and the compressibility parameters were insensitive to temperature changes.

In this paper we study partial covering problems in graphs in the realm of parameterized complexity. Classical (non-partial) version of all these problems have been intensively studied in planar graphs and in graphs excluding a fixed graph $H$ as a minor. However, the techniques developed for parameterized version of non-partial covering problems cannot be applied directly to their partial counterparts. The approach we use, to show that various partial covering problems are fixed parameter tractable on planar graphs, graphs of bounded local treewidth and graph excluding some graph as a minor, is quite different from previously known techniques.

Starting with a very natural setting for strategies available to the advertisers, and via a careful look through the algorithmic lens, we first propose solution concepts for the game originating from the strategic behavior of advertisers as they try to optimize their budget allocation across various keywords. Next, we consider two broad match scenarios based on factors such as information asymmetry between advertisers and the auctioneer, and the extent of auctioneer's control on the budget splitting. In the first scenario, the advertisers have the full information about broad match and relevant parameters, and can reapportion their own budgets to utilize the extra information; in particular, the auctioneer has no direct control over budget splitting. We show that, the same broad match may lead to different equilibria, one leading to a revenue improvement, whereas another to a revenue loss. This leaves the auctioneer in a dilemma - whether to broad-match or not. This motivates us to consider another broad match scenario, where the advertisers have information only about the current scenario, and the allocation of the budgets unspent in the current scenario is in the control of the auctioneer. We observe that the auctioneer can always improve his revenue by judiciously using broad match.

In these cases, a more appropriate assumption would be that the data lies on a statistical manifold, or a manifold of probability density functions (PDFs). In this paper we propose using the properties of information geometry in order to define similarities between data sets using the Fisher information metric. We will show this metric can be approximated using entirely non-parametric methods, as the parameterization of the manifold is generally unknown. Furthermore, by using multi-dimensional scaling methods, we are able to embed the corresponding PDFs into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This not only allows for classification of the data, but also visualization of the manifold.

However, nowadays we are witnessing a slowdown in performance progress, which may be considered as a sign that the saturation-based technology is reaching its inherent limits. The position I am trying to put forward in this paper is that such scepticism is premature and a sharp improvement in performance may potentially be reached by adopting new architectural principles for saturation. The top-level algorithms and corresponding designs used in the state-of-the-art saturation-based theorem provers have (at least) two inherent drawbacks: the insufficient flexibility of the used inference selection mechanisms and the lack of means for intelligent prioritising of search directions. In this position paper I analyse these drawbacks and present two ideas on how they could be overcome.

Variants of these games - defined by the type of moves allowed for the players - have been found to be closely connected to graph decompositions and associated width measures such as path- or tree-width. Of particular interest is the question whether these games are monotone, i.e. whether the cops can catch a robber without ever allowing the robber to reach positions that have been cleared before. The monotonicity problem for graph searching games has intensely been studied in the literature, but for two types of games the problem was left unresolved. These are the games on digraphs where the robber is invisible and lazy or visible and fast. In this paper, we solve the problems by giving examples showing that both types of games are non-monotone. Graph searching games on digraphs are closely related to recent proposals for digraph decompositions generalising tree-width to directed graphs. These proposals have partly been motivated by attempts to develop a structure theory for digraphs similar to the graph minor theory developed by Robertson and Seymour for undirected graphs, and partly by the immense number of algorithmic results using tree-width of undirected graphs and the hope that part of this success might be reproducible on digraphs using a directed tree-width. Unfortunately the number of applications for the digraphs measures introduced so far is still small. We therefore explore the limits of the algorithmic applicability of digraph decompositions.

Compressed Counting (CC) is proposed for efficiently computing the pth frequency moment of a data stream signal A_t, where 0<p<=2. CC is applicable if the streaming data follow the Turnstile model, with the restriction that at the time t for the evaluation, A_t[i]>= 0, which includes the strict Turnstile model as a special case.

A number of methods to generate multiclass SVMs from binary SVMs have been proposed by researchers and is still a continuing research topic. This paper compares the performance of six multi-class approaches to solve classification problem with remote sensing data in term of classification accuracy and computational cost. One vs. one, one vs. rest, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Error Corrected Output Coding (ECOC) based multiclass approaches creates many binary classifiers and combines their results to determine the class label of a test pixel. Another catogery of multi class approach modify the binary class objective function and allows simultaneous computation of multiclass classification by solving a single optimisation problem. Results from this study conclude the usefulness of One vs. One multi class approach in term of accuracy and computational cost over other multi class approaches.", "categories": ["cs.ne", "cs.cv"], "authors": ["Mahesh Pal"], "primary_category": "cs.ne", "published_date": "Mon, 18 Feb 2008 03:47:45 GMT", "updated_date": "Mon, 18 Feb 2008 03:47:45 GMT"}

This problem is motivated by the increasing use of distributed computing to handle large, computationally intensive tasks. In the SUU problem we are given n unit-length jobs and m machines, a directed acyclic graph G of precedence constraints among jobs, and unrelated failure probabilities q_{ij} for each job j when executed on machine i for a single timestep. Our goal is to find a schedule that minimizes the expected makespan, which is the expected time at which all jobs complete.   Lin and Rajaraman gave the first approximations for this NP-hard problem for the special cases of independent jobs, precedence constraints forming disjoint chains, and precedence constraints forming trees. In this paper, we present asymptotically better approximation algorithms. In particular, we give an O(loglog min(m,n))-approximation for independent jobs (improving on the previously best O(log n)-approximation). We also give an O(log(n+m) loglog min(m,n))-approximation algorithm for precedence constraints that form disjoint chains (improving on the previously best O(log(n)log(m)log(n+m)/loglog(n+m))-approximation by a (log n/loglog n)^2 factor when n = poly(m).

These forecasters are assessed in terms of their simple regret, a regret notion that captures the fact that exploration is only constrained by the number of available rounds (not necessarily known in advance), in contrast to the case when the cumulative regret is considered and when exploitation needs to be performed at the same time. We believe that this performance criterion is suited to situations when the cost of pulling an arm is expressed in terms of resources rather than rewards. We discuss the links between the simple and the cumulative regret. One of the main results in the case of a finite number of arms is a general lower bound on the simple regret of a forecaster in terms of its cumulative regret: the smaller the latter, the larger the former. Keeping this result in mind, we then exhibit upper bounds on the simple regret of some forecasters. The paper ends with a study devoted to continuous-armed bandit problems; we show that the simple regret can be minimized with respect to a family of probability distributions if and only if the cumulative regret can be minimized for it.

This improves the earlier known bounds of non-uniform SPL by (Allender et al. 1999) and $NC^2$ by (Miller and Naor 1995, Mahajan and Varadarajan 2000). It also rekindles the hope of obtaining a deterministic parallel algorithm for constructing a perfect matching in non-bipartite planar graphs, which has been open for a long time.

Linearity tests were first introduced by (Blum, Luby and Rubenfeld, 1993), and were later used in the PCP theorem, among other applications. The quality of a linearity test is described by its correctness c - the probability it accepts linear functions, its soundness s - the probability it accepts functions far from linear, and its query complexity q - the number of queries it makes. Linearity tests were studied in order to decrease the soundness of linearity tests, while keeping the query complexity small (for one reason, to improve PCP constructions). Samorodnitsky and Trevisan (Samorodnitsky and Trevisan 2000) constructed the Complete Graph Test, and prove that no Hyper Graph Test can perform better than the Complete Graph Test. Later in (Samorodnitsky and Trevisan 2006) they prove, among other results, that no non-adaptive linearity test can perform better than the Complete Graph Test. Their proof uses the algebraic machinery of the Gowers Norm. A result by (Ben-Sasson, Harsha and Raskhodnikova 2005) allows to generalize this lower bound also to adaptive linearity tests. We also prove the same optimal lower bound for adaptive linearity test, but our proof technique is arguably simpler and more direct than the one used in (Samorodnitsky and Trevisan 2006).

For microarray and other high-dimensional data, the presence of many noise variables may mask underlying clustering structures. Hence removing noise variables via variable selection is necessary. For simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation, existing penalized likelihood approaches in model-based clustering analysis all assume a common diagonal covariance matrix across clusters, which however may not hold in practice. To analyze high-dimensional data, particularly those with relatively low sample sizes, this article introduces a novel approach that shrinks the variances together with means, in a more general situation with cluster-specific (diagonal) covariance matrices. Furthermore, selection of grouped variables via inclusion or exclusion of a group of variables altogether is permitted by a specific form of penalty, which facilitates incorporating subject-matter knowledge, such as gene functions in clustering microarray samples for disease subtype discovery. For implementation, EM algorithms are derived for parameter estimation, in which the M-steps clearly demonstrate the effects of shrinkage and thresholding.

We formally define the semantics of the extended language (called DLP^A), and illustrate how it can be profitably used for representing knowledge. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity of DLP^A, showing that the addition of aggregates does not bring a higher cost in that respect.

This contrasts with the heuristic approaches used in the image segmentation literature that formulate those problems as nonlinear optimization problems, which are then relaxed and solved with spectral techniques in real numbers. These approaches not only fail to deliver an optimal solution, but they are also computationally expensive.

In contrast, our process enables complete formal analysis. It is based on the combination of two simple processes: a random walk process, and an harmonic forgetting process. Both processes reflect natural behaviors of the individuals, viewed as nodes in the network of inter-individual acquaintances. We prove that, in k-dimensional lattices, the combination of these two processes generates long-range links mutually independently distributed as a k-harmonic distribution. We analyze the performances of greedy routing at the stationary regime of our process, and prove that the expected number of steps for routing from any source to any target in any multidimensional lattice is a polylogarithmic function of the distance between the two nodes in the lattice. Up to our knowledge, these results are the first formal proof that navigability in small worlds can emerge from a dynamical process for network evolution. Our dynamical process can find practical applications to the design of spatial gossip and resource location protocols.", "categories": ["cs.ds"], "authors": ["Augustin Chaintreau", "Pierre Fraigniaud", "Emmanuelle Lebhar"], "primary_category": "cs.ds", "published_date": "Mon, 3 Mar 2008 14:44:08 GMT", "updated_date": "Mon, 3 Mar 2008 14:44:08 GMT"}
