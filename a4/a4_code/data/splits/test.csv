0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Intensive care data are valuable for improvement of health care, policy making and many other purposes. Vast amount of such data are stored in different locations, on many different devices and in different data silos. Sharing data among different sources is a big challenge due to regulatory, operational and security reasons. One potential solution is federated machine learning, which is a method that sends machine learning algorithms simultaneously to all data sources, trains models in each source and aggregates the learned models. This strategy allows utilization of valuable data without moving them. One challenge in applying federated machine learning is the possibly different distributions of data from diverse sources. To tackle this problem, we proposed an adaptive boosting method named LoAdaBoost that increases the efficiency of federated machine learning. Using intensive care unit data from hospitals, we investigated the performance of learning in IID and non-IID data distribution scenarios, and showed that the proposed LoAdaBoost method achieved higher predictive accuracy with lower computational complexity than the baseline method.",1
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated Learning allows multiple parties to jointly train a deep learning model on their combined data, without any of the participants having to reveal their local data to a centralized server. This form of privacy-preserving collaborative learning however comes at the cost of a significant communication overhead during training. To address this problem, several compression methods have been proposed in the distributed training literature that can reduce the amount of required communication by up to three orders of magnitude. These existing methods however are only of limited utility in the Federated Learning setting, as they either only compress the upstream communication from the clients to the server (leaving the downstream communication uncompressed) or only perform well under idealized conditions such as iid distribution of the client data, which typically can not be found in Federated Learning. In this work, we propose Sparse Ternary Compression (STC), a new compression framework that is specifically designed to meet the requirements of the Federated Learning environment. Our experiments on four different learning tasks demonstrate that STC distinctively outperforms Federated Averaging in common Federated Learning scenarios where clients either a) hold non-iid data, b) use small batch sizes during training, or where c) the number of clients is large and the participation rate in every communication round is low. We furthermore show that even if the clients hold iid data and use medium sized batches for training, STC still behaves pareto-superior to Federated Averaging in the sense that it achieves fixed target accuracies on our benchmarks within both fewer training iterations and a smaller communication budget.",1
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Electronic medical records (EMRs) supports the development of machine learning algorithms for predicting disease incidence, patient response to treatment, and other healthcare events. But insofar most algorithms have been centralized, taking little account of the decentralized, non-identically independently distributed (non-IID), and privacy-sensitive characteristics of EMRs that can complicate data collection, sharing and learning. To address this challenge, we introduced a community-based federated machine learning (CBFL) algorithm and evaluated it on non-IID ICU EMRs. Our algorithm clustered the distributed data into clinically meaningful communities that captured similar diagnoses and geological locations, and learnt one model for each community. Throughout the learning process, the data was kept local on hospitals, while locally-computed results were aggregated on a server. Evaluation results show that CBFL outperformed the baseline FL algorithm in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PR AUC), and communication cost between hospitals and the server. Furthermore, communities' performance difference could be explained by how dissimilar one community was to others.",1
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"On-device machine learning (ML) enables the training process to exploit a massive amount of user-generated private data samples. To enjoy this benefit, inter-device communication overhead should be minimized. With this end, we propose federated distillation (FD), a distributed model training algorithm whose communication payload size is much smaller than a benchmark scheme, federated learning (FL), particularly when the model size is large. Moreover, user-generated data samples are likely to become non-IID across devices, which commonly degrades the performance compared to the case with an IID dataset. To cope with this, we propose federated augmentation (FAug), where each device collectively trains a generative model, and thereby augments its local data towards yielding an IID dataset. Empirical studies demonstrate that FD with FAug yields around 26x less communication overhead while achieving 95-98% test accuracy compared to FL.",1
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated learning enables resource-constrained edge compute devices, such as mobile phones and IoT devices, to learn a shared model for prediction, while keeping the training data local. This decentralized approach to train models provides privacy, security, regulatory and economic benefits. In this work, we focus on the statistical challenge of federated learning when local data is non-IID. We first show that the accuracy of federated learning reduces significantly, by up to 55% for neural networks trained for highly skewed non-IID data, where each client device trains only on a single class of data. We further show that this accuracy reduction can be explained by the weight divergence, which can be quantified by the earth mover's distance (EMD) between the distribution over classes on each device and the population distribution. As a solution, we propose a strategy to improve training on non-IID data by creating a small subset of data which is globally shared between all the edge devices. Experiments show that accuracy can be increased by 30% for the CIFAR-10 dataset with only 5% globally shared data.",1
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"The estimation of treatment effects is a pervasive problem in medicine. Existing methods for estimating treatment effects from longitudinal observational data assume that there are no hidden confounders, an assumption that is not testable in practice and, if it does not hold, leads to biased estimates. In this paper, we develop the Time Series Deconfounder, a method that leverages the assignment of multiple treatments over time to enable the estimation of treatment effects in the presence of multi-cause hidden confounders. The Time Series Deconfounder uses a novel recurrent neural network architecture with multitask output to build a factor model over time and infer latent variables that render the assigned treatments conditionally independent; then, it performs causal inference using these latent variables that act as substitutes for the multi-cause unobserved confounders. We provide a theoretical analysis for obtaining unbiased causal effects of time-varying exposures using the Time Series Deconfounder. Using both simulated and real data we show the effectiveness of our method in deconfounding the estimation of treatment responses over time.",1
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Consider the case that one observes a single time-series, where at each time t one observes a data record O(t) involving treatment nodes A(t), possible covariates L(t) and an outcome node Y(t). The data record at time t carries information for an (potentially causal) effect of the treatment A(t) on the outcome Y(t), in the context defined by a fixed dimensional summary measure Co(t). We are concerned with defining causal effects that can be consistently estimated, with valid inference, for sequentially randomized experiments without further assumptions. More generally, we consider the case when the (possibly causal) effects can be estimated in a double robust manner, analogue to double robust estimation of effects in the i.i.d. causal inference literature. We propose a general class of averages of conditional (context-specific) causal parameters that can be estimated in a double robust manner, therefore fully utilizing the sequential randomization. We propose a targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) of these causal parameters, and present a general theorem establishing the asymptotic consistency and normality of the TMLE. We extend our general framework to a number of typically studied causal target parameters, including a sequentially adaptive design within a single unit that learns the optimal treatment rule for the unit over time. Our work opens up robust statistical inference for causal questions based on observing a single time-series on a particular unit.",1
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"The estimation of optimal treatment regimes is of considerable interest to precision medicine. In this work, we propose a causal $k$-nearest neighbor method to estimate the optimal treatment regime. The method roots in the framework of causal inference, and estimates the causal treatment effects within the nearest neighborhood. Although the method is simple, it possesses nice theoretical properties. We show that the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime is universally consistent. That is, the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime will eventually learn the optimal treatment regime as the sample size increases. We also establish its convergence rate. However, the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime may suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e. performance deteriorates as dimensionality increases. To alleviate this problem, we develop an adaptive causal $k$-nearest neighbor method to perform metric selection and variable selection simultaneously. The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in simulation studies and in an analysis of a chronic depression clinical trial.",1
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's outcome. The challenge is that the ""ground truth"" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.",1
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Many decisions in healthcare, business, and other policy domains are made without the support of rigorous evidence due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized experiments. Using observational data to answer causal questions is risky: subjects who receive different treatments also differ in other ways that affect outcomes. Many causal inference methods have been developed to mitigate these biases. However, there is no way to know which method might produce the best estimate of a treatment effect in a given study. In analogy to cross-validation, which estimates the prediction error of predictive models applied to a given dataset, we propose synth-validation, a procedure that estimates the estimation error of causal inference methods applied to a given dataset. In synth-validation, we use the observed data to estimate generative distributions with known treatment effects. We apply each causal inference method to datasets sampled from these distributions and compare the effect estimates with the known effects to estimate error. Using simulations, we show that using synth-validation to select a causal inference method for each study lowers the expected estimation error relative to consistently using any single method.",1
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"This paper provides a link between causal inference and machine learning techniques - specifically, Classification and Regression Trees (CART) - in observational studies where the receipt of the treatment is not randomized, but the assignment to the treatment can be assumed to be randomized (irregular assignment mechanism). The paper contributes to the growing applied machine learning literature on causal inference, by proposing a modified version of the Causal Tree (CT) algorithm to draw causal inference from an irregular assignment mechanism. The proposed method is developed by merging the CT approach with the instrumental variable framework to causal inference, hence the name Causal Tree with Instrumental Variable (CT-IV). As compared to CT, the main strength of CT-IV is that it can deal more efficiently with the heterogeneity of causal effects, as demonstrated by a series of numerical results obtained on synthetic data. Then, the proposed algorithm is used to evaluate a public policy implemented by the Tuscan Regional Administration (Italy), which aimed at easing the access to credit for small firms. In this context, CT-IV breaks fresh ground for target-based policies, identifying interesting heterogeneous causal effects.",1
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"The study of causality or causal inference - how much a given treatment causally affects a given outcome in a population - goes way beyond correlation or association analysis of variables, and is critical in making sound data driven decisions and policies in a multitude of applications. The gold standard in causal inference is performing ""controlled experiments"", which often is not possible due to logistical or ethical reasons. As an alternative, inferring causality on ""observational data"" based on the ""Neyman-Rubin potential outcome model"" has been extensively used in statistics, economics, and social sciences over several decades. In this paper, we present a formal framework for sound causal analysis on observational datasets that are given as multiple relations and where the population under study is obtained by joining these base relations. We study a crucial condition for inferring causality from observational data, called the ""strong ignorability assumption"" (the treatment and outcome variables should be independent in the joined relation given the observed covariates), using known conditional independences that hold in the base relations. We also discuss how the structure of the conditional independences in base relations given as graphical models help infer new conditional independences in the joined relation. The proposed framework combines concepts from databases, statistics, and graphical models, and aims to initiate new research directions spanning these fields to facilitate powerful data-driven decisions in today's big data world.",1
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We discuss the relevance of the recent Machine Learning (ML) literature for economics and econometrics. First we discuss the differences in goals, methods and settings between the ML literature and the traditional econometrics and statistics literatures. Then we discuss some specific methods from the machine learning literature that we view as important for empirical researchers in economics. These include supervised learning methods for regression and classification, unsupervised learning methods, as well as matrix completion methods. Finally, we highlight newly developed methods at the intersection of ML and econometrics, methods that typically perform better than either off-the-shelf ML or more traditional econometric methods when applied to particular classes of problems, problems that include causal inference for average treatment effects, optimal policy estimation, and estimation of the counterfactual effect of price changes in consumer choice models.",1
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Many applications of causal analysis call for assessing, retrospectively, the effect of withholding an action that has in fact been implemented. This counterfactual quantity, sometimes called ""effect of treatment on the treated,"" (ETT) have been used to to evaluate educational programs, critic public policies, and justify individual decision making. In this paper we explore the conditions under which ETT can be estimated from (i.e., identified in) experimental and/or observational studies. We show that, when the action invokes a singleton variable, the conditions for ETT identification have simple characterizations in terms of causal diagrams. We further give a graphical characterization of the conditions under which the effects of multiple treatments on the treated can be identified, as well as ways in which the ETT estimand can be constructed from both interventional and observational distributions.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Molecular structure-property relationships are key to molecular engineering for materials and drug discovery. The rise of deep learning offers a new viable solution to elucidate the structure-property relationships directly from chemical data. Here we show that the performance of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for the prediction of molecular properties can be improved by incorporating attention and gate mechanisms. The attention mechanism enables a GCN to identify atoms in different environments. The gated skip-connection further improves the GCN by updating feature maps at an appropriate rate. We demonstrate that the resulting attention- and gate-augmented GCN could extract better structural features related to a target molecular property such as solubility, polarity, synthetic accessibility and photovoltaic efficiency compared to the vanilla GCN. More interestingly, it identified two distinct parts of molecules as essential structural features for high photovoltaic efficiency, and each of them coincided with the areas of donor and acceptor orbitals for charge-transfer excitations, respectively. As a result, the new model could accurately predict molecular properties and place molecules with similar properties close to each other in a well-trained latent space, which is critical for successful molecular engineering.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph convolutional network (GCN) is generalization of convolutional neural network (CNN) to work with arbitrarily structured graphs. A binary adjacency matrix is commonly used in training a GCN. Recently, the attention mechanism allows the network to learn a dynamic and adaptive aggregation of the neighborhood. We propose a new GCN model on the graphs where edges are characterized in multiple views or precisely in terms of multiple relationships. For instance, in chemical graph theory, compound structures are often represented by the hydrogen-depleted molecular graph where nodes correspond to atoms and edges correspond to chemical bonds. Multiple attributes can be important to characterize chemical bonds, such as atom pair (the types of atoms that a bond connects), aromaticity, and whether a bond is in a ring. The different attributes lead to different graph representations for the same molecule. There is growing interests in both chemistry and machine learning fields to directly learn molecular properties of compounds from the molecular graph, instead of from fingerprints predefined by chemists. The proposed GCN model, which we call edge attention-based multi-relational GCN (EAGCN), jointly learns attention weights and node features in graph convolution. For each bond attribute, a real-valued attention matrix is used to replace the binary adjacency matrix. By designing a dictionary for the edge attention, and forming the attention matrix of each molecule by looking up the dictionary, the EAGCN exploits correspondence between bonds in different molecules. The prediction of compound properties is based on the aggregated node features, which is independent of the varying molecule (graph) size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the EAGCN on multiple chemical datasets: Tox21, HIV, Freesolv, and Lipophilicity, and interpret the resultant attention weights.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies are critical for drug discovery. Conventionally, these tasks, together with other chemical property predictions, rely on domain-specific feature descriptors, or fingerprints. Following the recent success of neural networks, we developed Chemi-Net, a completely data-driven, domain knowledge-free, deep learning method for ADME property prediction. To compare the relative performance of Chemi-Net with Cubist, one of the popular machine learning programs used by Amgen, a large-scale ADME property prediction study was performed on-site at Amgen. The results showed that our deep neural network method improved current methods by a large margin. We foresee that the significantly increased accuracy of ADME prediction seen with Chemi-Net over Cubist will greatly accelerate drug discovery.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Machine learning techniques have recently been adopted in various applications in medicine, biology, chemistry, and material engineering. An important task is to predict the properties of molecules, which serves as the main subroutine in many downstream applications such as virtual screening and drug design. Despite the increasing interest, the key challenge is to construct proper representations of molecules for learning algorithms. This paper introduces the N-gram graph, a simple unsupervised representation for molecules. The method first embeds the vertices in the molecule graph. It then constructs a compact representation for the graph by assembling the vertex embeddings in short walks in the graph, which we show is equivalent to a simple graph neural network that needs no training. The representations can thus be efficiently computed and then used with supervised learning methods for prediction. Experiments on 60 tasks from 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate its advantages over both popular graph neural networks and traditional representation methods. This is complemented by theoretical analysis showing its strong representation and prediction power.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a popular architecture for the analysis of chemical molecules, and it has numerous applications in material and medicinal science. Current lines of GNNs developed for molecular analysis, however, do not fit well on the training set, and their performance does not scale well with the complexity of the network. In this paper, we propose an auxiliary module to be attached to a GNN that can boost the representation power of the model without hindering with the original GNN architecture. Our auxiliary module can be attached to a wide variety of GNNs, including those that are used commonly in biochemical applications. With our auxiliary architecture, the performances of many GNNs used in practice improve more consistently, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on popular molecular graph datasets.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Advancements in neural machinery have led to a wide range of algorithmic solutions for molecular property prediction. Two classes of models in particular have yielded promising results: neural networks applied to computed molecular fingerprints or expert-crafted descriptors, and graph convolutional neural networks that construct a learned molecular representation by operating on the graph structure of the molecule. However, recent literature has yet to clearly determine which of these two methods is superior when generalizing to new chemical space. Furthermore, prior research has rarely examined these new models in industry research settings in comparison to existing employed models. In this paper, we benchmark models extensively on 19 public and 16 proprietary industrial datasets spanning a wide variety of chemical endpoints. In addition, we introduce a graph convolutional model that consistently matches or outperforms models using fixed molecular descriptors as well as previous graph neural architectures on both public and proprietary datasets. Our empirical findings indicate that while approaches based on these representations have yet to reach the level of experimental reproducibility, our proposed model nevertheless offers significant improvements over models currently used in industrial workflows.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"The Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug candidates are estimated to account for up to 50% of all clinical trial failures. Predicting ADMET properties has therefore been of great interest to the cheminformatics and medicinal chemistry communities in recent decades. Traditional cheminformatics approaches, whether the learner is a random forest or a deep neural network, leverage fixed fingerprint feature representations of molecules. In contrast, in this paper, we learn the features most relevant to each chemical task at hand by representing each molecule explicitly as a graph, where each node is an atom and each edge is a bond. By applying graph convolutions to this explicit molecular representation, we achieve, to our knowledge, unprecedented accuracy in prediction of ADMET properties. By challenging our methodology with rigorous cross-validation procedures and prospective analyses, we show that deep featurization better enables molecular predictors to not only interpolate but also extrapolate to new regions of chemical space.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Recent advances in machine learning have made significant contributions to drug discovery. Deep neural networks in particular have been demonstrated to provide significant boosts in predictive power when inferring the properties and activities of small-molecule compounds. However, the applicability of these techniques has been limited by the requirement for large amounts of training data. In this work, we demonstrate how one-shot learning can be used to significantly lower the amounts of data required to make meaningful predictions in drug discovery applications. We introduce a new architecture, the residual LSTM embedding, that, when combined with graph convolutional neural networks, significantly improves the ability to learn meaningful distance metrics over small-molecules. We open source all models introduced in this work as part of DeepChem, an open-source framework for deep-learning in drug discovery.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Functional groups (FGs) are molecular substructures that are served as a foundation for analyzing and predicting chemical properties of molecules. Automatic discovery of FGs will impact various fields of research, including medicinal chemistry and material sciences, by reducing the amount of lab experiments required for discovery or synthesis of new molecules. In this paper, we investigate methods based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) for localizing FGs that contribute to specific chemical properties of interest. In our framework, molecules are modeled as undirected relational graphs with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. Using this relational graph structure, we trained GCNNs in a supervised way on experimentally-validated molecular training sets to predict specific chemical properties, e.g., toxicity. Upon learning a GCNN, we analyzed its activation patterns to automatically identify FGs using four different explainability methods that we have developed: gradient-based saliency maps, Class Activation Mapping (CAM), gradient-weighted CAM (Grad-CAM), and Excitation Back-Propagation. Although these methods are originally derived for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we adapt them to develop the corresponding suitable versions for GCNNs. We evaluated the contrastive power of these methods with respect to the specificity of the identified molecular substructures and their relevance for chemical functions. Grad-CAM had the highest contrastive power and generated qualitatively the best FGs. This work paves the way for automatic analysis and design of new molecules.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"The arc of drug discovery entails a multiparameter optimization problem spanning vast length scales. They key parameters range from solubility (angstroms) to protein-ligand binding (nanometers) to in vivo toxicity (meters). Through feature learning---instead of feature engineering---deep neural networks promise to outperform both traditional physics-based and knowledge-based machine learning models for predicting molecular properties pertinent to drug discovery. To this end, we present the PotentialNet family of graph convolutions. These models are specifically designed for and achieve state-of-the-art performance for protein-ligand binding affinity. We further validate these deep neural networks by setting new standards of performance in several ligand-based tasks. In parallel, we introduce a new metric, the Regression Enrichment Factor $EF_\chi^{(R)}$, to measure the early enrichment of computational models for chemical data. Finally, we introduce a cross-validation strategy based on structural homology clustering that can more accurately measure model generalizability, which crucially distinguishes the aims of machine learning for drug discovery from standard machine learning tasks.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Supervised learning on molecules has incredible potential to be useful in chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Generating novel graph structures that optimize given objectives while obeying some given underlying rules is fundamental for chemistry, biology and social science research. This is especially important in the task of molecular graph generation, whose goal is to discover novel molecules with desired properties such as drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, while obeying physical laws such as chemical valency. However, designing models to find molecules that optimize desired properties while incorporating highly complex and non-differentiable rules remains to be a challenging task. Here we propose Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN), a general graph convolutional network based model for goal-directed graph generation through reinforcement learning. The model is trained to optimize domain-specific rewards and adversarial loss through policy gradient, and acts in an environment that incorporates domain-specific rules. Experimental results show that GCPN can achieve 61% improvement on chemical property optimization over state-of-the-art baselines while resembling known molecules, and achieve 184% improvement on the constrained property optimization task.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Molecular activity prediction is critical in drug design. Machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and random forests have been successful for this task. These models require fixed-size feature vectors as input while the molecules are variable in size and structure. As a result, fixed-size fingerprint representation is poor in handling substructures for large molecules. In addition, molecular activity tests, or a so-called BioAssays, are relatively small in the number of tested molecules due to its complexity. Here we approach the problem through deep neural networks as they are flexible in modeling structured data such as grids, sequences and graphs. We train multiple BioAssays using a multi-task learning framework, which combines information from multiple sources to improve the performance of prediction, especially on small datasets. We propose Graph Memory Network (GraphMem), a memory-augmented neural network to model the graph structure in molecules. GraphMem consists of a recurrent controller coupled with an external memory whose cells dynamically interact and change through a multi-hop reasoning process. Applied to the molecules, the dynamic interactions enable an iterative refinement of the representation of molecular graphs with multiple bond types. GraphMem is capable of jointly training on multiple datasets by using a specific-task query fed to the controller as an input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for separately and jointly training on more than 100K measurements, spanning across 9 BioAssay activity tests.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"We propose a novel neural method to extract drug-drug interactions (DDIs) from texts using external drug molecular structure information. We encode textual drug pairs with convolutional neural networks and their molecular pairs with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and then we concatenate the outputs of these two networks. In the experiments, we show that GCNs can predict DDIs from the molecular structures of drugs in high accuracy and the molecular information can enhance text-based DDI extraction by 2.39 percent points in the F-score on the DDIExtraction 2013 shared task data set.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Predicating macroscopic influences of drugs on human body, like efficacy and toxicity, is a central problem of small-molecule based drug discovery. Molecules can be represented as an undirected graph, and we can utilize graph convolution networks to predication molecular properties. However, graph convolutional networks and other graph neural networks all focus on learning node-level representation rather than graph-level representation. Previous works simply sum all feature vectors for all nodes in the graph to obtain the graph feature vector for drug predication. In this paper, we introduce a dummy super node that is connected with all nodes in the graph by a directed edge as the representation of the graph and modify the graph operation to help the dummy super node learn graph-level feature. Thus, we can handle graph-level classification and regression in the same way as node-level classification and regression. In addition, we apply focal loss to address class imbalance in drug datasets. The experiments on MoleculeNet show that our method can effectively improve the performance of molecular properties predication.",1
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"In this paper, we presented a novel convolutional neural network framework for graph modeling, with the introduction of two new modules specially designed for graph-structured data: the $k$-th order convolution operator and the adaptive filtering module. Importantly, our framework of High-order and Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (HA-GCN) is a general-purposed architecture that fits various applications on both node and graph centrics, as well as graph generative models. We conducted extensive experiments on demonstrating the advantages of our framework. Particularly, our HA-GCN outperforms the state-of-the-art models on node classification and molecule property prediction tasks. It also generates 32% more real molecules on the molecule generation task, both of which will significantly benefit real-world applications such as material design and drug screening.",1
19,Benchmarking time-series forecasting models (ARIMA,"In this paper we study different approaches for time series modeling. The forecasting approaches using linear models, ARIMA alpgorithm, XGBoost machine learning algorithm are described. Results of different model combinations are shown. For probabilistic modeling the approaches using copulas and Bayesian inference are considered.",1
19,Benchmarking time-series forecasting models (ARIMA,"Forecasting time series data is an important subject in economics, business, and finance. Traditionally, there are several techniques to effectively forecast the next lag of time series data such as univariate Autoregressive (AR), univariate Moving Average (MA), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), and more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with its many variations. In particular, ARIMA model has demonstrated its outperformance in precision and accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series. With the recent advancement in computational power of computers and more importantly developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as deep learning, new algorithms are developed to forecast time series data. The research question investigated in this article is that whether and how the newly developed deep learning-based algorithms for forecasting time series data, such as ""Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)"", are superior to the traditional algorithms. The empirical studies conducted and reported in this article show that deep learning-based algorithms such as LSTM outperform traditional-based algorithms such as ARIMA model. More specifically, the average reduction in error rates obtained by LSTM is between 84 - 87 percent when compared to ARIMA indicating the superiority of LSTM to ARIMA. Furthermore, it was noticed that the number of training times, known as ""epoch"" in deep learning, has no effect on the performance of the trained forecast model and it exhibits a truly random behavior.",1
19,Benchmarking time-series forecasting models (ARIMA,"Many applications in different domains produce large amount of time series data. Making accurate forecasting is critical for many decision makers. Various time series forecasting methods exist which use linear and nonlinear models separately or combination of both. Studies show that combining of linear and nonlinear models can be effective to improve forecasting performance. However, some assumptions that those existing methods make, might restrict their performance in certain situations. We provide a new Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)-Artificial Neural Network(ANN) hybrid method that work in a more general framework. Experimental results show that strategies for decomposing the original data and for combining linear and nonlinear models throughout the hybridization process are key factors in the forecasting performance of the methods. By using appropriate strategies, our hybrid method can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy obtained by traditional hybrid methods and also either of the individual methods used separately.",1
20,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"Deep learning for clinical applications is subject to stringent performance requirements, which raises a need for large labeled datasets. However, the enormous cost of labeling medical data makes this challenging. In this paper, we build a cost-sensitive active learning system for the problem of intracranial hemorrhage detection and segmentation on head computed tomography (CT). We show that our ensemble method compares favorably with the state-of-the-art, while running faster and using less memory. Moreover, our experiments are done using a substantially larger dataset than earlier papers on this topic. Since the labeling time could vary tremendously across examples, we model the labeling time and optimize the return on investment. We validate this idea by core-set selection on our large labeled dataset and by growing it with data from the wild.",1
20,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"We introduce a novel strategy for learning to extract semantically meaningful features from aerial imagery. Instead of manually labeling the aerial imagery, we propose to predict (noisy) semantic features automatically extracted from co-located ground imagery. Our network architecture takes an aerial image as input, extracts features using a convolutional neural network, and then applies an adaptive transformation to map these features into the ground-level perspective. We use an end-to-end learning approach to minimize the difference between the semantic segmentation extracted directly from the ground image and the semantic segmentation predicted solely based on the aerial image. We show that a model learned using this strategy, with no additional training, is already capable of rough semantic labeling of aerial imagery. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by finetuning this model we can achieve more accurate semantic segmentation than two baseline initialization strategies. We use our network to address the task of estimating the geolocation and geoorientation of a ground image. Finally, we show how features extracted from an aerial image can be used to hallucinate a plausible ground-level panorama.",1
20,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"While active learning offers potential cost savings, the actual data efficiency---the reduction in amount of labeled data needed to obtain the same error rate---observed in practice is mixed. This paper poses a basic question: when is active learning actually helpful? We provide an answer for logistic regression with the popular active learning algorithm, uncertainty sampling. Empirically, on 21 datasets from OpenML, we find a strong inverse correlation between data efficiency and the error rate of the final classifier. Theoretically, we show that for a variant of uncertainty sampling, the asymptotic data efficiency is within a constant factor of the inverse error rate of the limiting classifier.",1
20,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"State of the art methods for semantic image segmentation are trained in a supervised fashion using a large corpus of fully labeled training images. However, gathering such a corpus is expensive, due to human annotation effort, in contrast to gathering unlabeled data. We propose an active learning-based strategy, called CEREALS, in which a human only has to hand-label a few, automatically selected, regions within an unlabeled image corpus. This minimizes human annotation effort while maximizing the performance of a semantic image segmentation method. The automatic selection procedure is achieved by: a) using a suitable information measure combined with an estimate about human annotation effort, which is inferred from a learned cost model, and b) exploiting the spatial coherency of an image. The performance of CEREALS is demonstrated on Cityscapes, where we are able to reduce the annotation effort to 17%, while keeping 95% of the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of a model that was trained with the fully annotated training set of Cityscapes.",1
20,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"Training a deep object detector for autonomous driving requires a huge amount of labeled data. While recording data via on-board sensors such as camera or LiDAR is relatively easy, annotating data is very tedious and time-consuming, especially when dealing with 3D LiDAR points or radar data. Active learning has the potential to minimize human annotation efforts while maximizing the object detector's performance. In this work, we propose an active learning method to train a LiDAR 3D object detector with the least amount of labeled training data necessary. The detector leverages 2D region proposals generated from the RGB images to reduce the search space of objects and speed up the learning process. Experiments show that our proposed method works under different uncertainty estimations and query functions, and can save up to 60% of the labeling efforts while reaching the same network performance.",1
20,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"The great success that deep models have achieved in the past is mainly owed to large amounts of labeled training data. However, the acquisition of labeled data for new tasks aside from existing benchmarks is both challenging and costly. Active learning can make the process of labeling new data more efficient by selecting unlabeled samples which, when labeled, are expected to improve the model the most. In this paper, we combine a novel method of active learning for object detection with an incremental learning scheme to enable continuous exploration of new unlabeled datasets. We propose a set of uncertainty-based active learning metrics suitable for most object detectors. Furthermore, we present an approach to leverage class imbalances during sample selection. All methods are evaluated systematically in a continuous exploration context on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.",1
20,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"We propose a novel Active Learning framework capable to train effectively a convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation of medical imaging, with a limited amount of training labeled data.

20,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"We design an active learning algorithm for cost-sensitive multiclass classification: problems where different errors have different costs. Our algorithm, COAL, makes predictions by regressing to each label's cost and predicting the smallest. On a new example, it uses a set of regressors that perform well on past data to estimate possible costs for each label. It queries only the labels that could be the best, ignoring the sure losers. We prove COAL can be efficiently implemented for any regression family that admits squared loss optimization; it also enjoys strong guarantees with respect to predictive performance and labeling effort. We empirically compare COAL to passive learning and several active learning baselines, showing significant improvements in labeling effort and test cost on real-world datasets.",1
20,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"Active learning refers to the learning protocol where the learner is allowed to choose a subset of instances for labeling. Previous studies have shown that, compared with passive learning, active learning is able to reduce the label complexity exponentially if the data are linearly separable or satisfy the Tsybakov noise condition with parameter $\kappa=1$. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm using a convex surrogate loss, with the goal to broaden the cases for which active learning achieves an exponential improvement. We make use of a convex loss not only because it reduces the computational cost, but more importantly because it leads to a tight bound for the empirical process (i.e., the difference between the empirical estimation and the expectation) when the current solution is close to the optimal one. Under the assumption that the norm of the optimal classifier that minimizes the convex risk is available, our analysis shows that the introduction of the convex surrogate loss yields an exponential reduction in the label complexity even when the parameter $\kappa$ of the Tsybakov noise is larger than $1$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that improves the minimax rate of active learning by utilizing certain priori knowledge.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"Much of the success of single agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in recent years can be attributed to the use of experience replay memories (ERM), which allow Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) to be trained efficiently through sampling stored state transitions. However, care is required when using ERMs for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL), as stored transitions can become outdated because agents update their policies in parallel [11]. In this work we apply leniency [23] to MA-DRL. Lenient agents map state-action pairs to decaying temperature values that control the amount of leniency applied towards negative policy updates that are sampled from the ERM. This introduces optimism in the value-function update, and has been shown to facilitate cooperation in tabular fully-cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. We evaluate our Lenient-DQN (LDQN) empirically against the related Hysteretic-DQN (HDQN) algorithm [22] as well as a modified version we call scheduled-HDQN, that uses average reward learning near terminal states. Evaluations take place in extended variations of the Coordinated Multi-Agent Object Transportation Problem (CMOTP) [8] which include fully-cooperative sub-tasks and stochastic rewards. We find that LDQN agents are more likely to converge to the optimal policy in a stochastic reward CMOTP compared to standard and scheduled-HDQN agents.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"In this paper, we explore using deep reinforcement learning for problems with multiple agents. Most existing methods for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning consider only a small number of agents. When the number of agents increases, the dimensionality of the input and control spaces increase as well, and these methods do not scale well. To address this, we propose casting the multi-agent reinforcement learning problem as a distributed optimization problem. Our algorithm assumes that for multi-agent settings, policies of individual agents in a given population live close to each other in parameter space and can be approximated by a single policy. With this simple assumption, we show our algorithm to be extremely effective for reinforcement learning in multi-agent settings. We demonstrate its effectiveness against existing comparable approaches on co-operative and competitive tasks.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"Many reality tasks such as robot coordination can be naturally modelled as multi-agent cooperative system where the rewards are sparse. This paper focuses on learning decentralized policies for such tasks using sub-optimal demonstration. To learn the multi-agent cooperation effectively and tackle the sub-optimality of demonstration, a self-improving learning method is proposed: On the one hand, the centralized state-action values are initialized by the demonstration and updated by the learned decentralized policy to improve the sub-optimality. On the other hand, the Nash Equilibrium are found by the current state-action value and are used as a guide to learn the policy. The proposed method is evaluated on the combat RTS games which requires a high level of multi-agent cooperation. Extensive experimental results on various combat scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method can learn multi-agent cooperation effectively. It significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art demonstration based approaches.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a learning paradigm concerned with learning to control a system so as to maximize an objective over the long term. This approach to learning has received immense interest in recent times and success manifests itself in the form of human-level performance on games like \textit{Go}. While RL is emerging as a practical component in real-life systems, most successes have been in Single Agent domains. This report will instead specifically focus on challenges that are unique to Multi-Agent Systems interacting in mixed cooperative and competitive environments. The report concludes with advances in the paradigm of training Multi-Agent Systems called \textit{Decentralized Actor, Centralized Critic}, based on an extension of MDPs called \textit{Decentralized Partially Observable MDP}s, which has seen a renewed interest lately.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"Policy gradient methods are often applied to reinforcement learning in continuous multiagent games. These methods perform local search in the joint-action space, and as we show, they are susceptable to a game-theoretic pathology known as relative overgeneralization. To resolve this issue, we propose Multiagent Soft Q-learning, which can be seen as the analogue of applying Q-learning to continuous controls. We compare our method to MADDPG, a state-of-the-art approach, and show that our method achieves better coordination in multiagent cooperative tasks, converging to better local optima in the joint action space.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"Although many reinforcement learning methods have been proposed for learning the optimal solutions in single-agent continuous-action domains, multiagent coordination domains with continuous actions have received relatively few investigations. In this paper, we propose an independent learner hierarchical method, named Sample Continuous Coordination with recursive Frequency Maximum Q-Value (SCC-rFMQ), which divides the cooperative problem with continuous actions into two layers. The first layer samples a finite set of actions from the continuous action spaces by a re-sampling mechanism with variable exploratory rates, and the second layer evaluates the actions in the sampled action set and updates the policy using a reinforcement learning cooperative method. By constructing cooperative mechanisms at both levels, SCC-rFMQ can handle cooperative problems in continuous action cooperative Markov games effectively. The effectiveness of SCC-rFMQ is experimentally demonstrated on two well-designed games, i.e., a continuous version of the climbing game and a cooperative version of the boat problem. Experimental results show that SCC-rFMQ outperforms other reinforcement learning algorithms.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"Multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms (MARL) have been demonstrated on complex tasks that require the coordination of a team of multiple agents to complete. Existing works have focused on sharing information between agents via centralized critics to stabilize learning or through communication to increase performance, but do not generally look at how information can be shared between agents to address the curse of dimensionality in MARL. We posit that a multiagent problem can be decomposed into a multi-task problem where each agent explores a subset of the state space instead of exploring the entire state space. This paper introduces a multiagent actor-critic algorithm and method for combining knowledge from homogeneous agents through distillation and value-matching that outperforms policy distillation alone and allows further learning in both discrete and continuous action spaces.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"We study the problem of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with a single joint reward signal. This class of learning problems is difficult because of the often large combined action and observation spaces. In the fully centralized and decentralized approaches, we find the problem of spurious rewards and a phenomenon we call the ""lazy agent"" problem, which arises due to partial observability. We address these problems by training individual agents with a novel value decomposition network architecture, which learns to decompose the team value function into agent-wise value functions. We perform an experimental evaluation across a range of partially-observable multi-agent domains and show that learning such value-decompositions leads to superior results, in particular when combined with weight sharing, role information and information channels.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"Decision making in multi-agent systems (MAS) is a great challenge due to enormous state and joint action spaces as well as uncertainty, making centralized control generally infeasible. Decentralized control offers better scalability and robustness but requires mechanisms to coordinate on joint tasks and to avoid conflicts. Common approaches to learn decentralized policies for cooperative MAS suffer from non-stationarity and lacking credit assignment, which can lead to unstable and uncoordinated behavior in complex environments. In this paper, we propose Strong Emergent Policy approximation (STEP), a scalable approach to learn strong decentralized policies for cooperative MAS with a distributed variant of policy iteration. For that, we use function approximation to learn from action recommendations of a decentralized multi-agent planning algorithm. STEP combines decentralized multi-agent planning with centralized learning, only requiring a generative model for distributed black box optimization. We experimentally evaluate STEP in two challenging and stochastic domains with large state and joint action spaces and show that STEP is able to learn stronger policies than standard multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, when combining multi-agent open-loop planning with centralized function approximation. The learned policies can be reintegrated into the multi-agent planning process to further improve performance.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been around for decades and employed to solve various sequential decision-making problems. These algorithms however have faced great challenges when dealing with high-dimensional environments. The recent development of deep learning has enabled RL methods to drive optimal policies for sophisticated and capable agents, which can perform efficiently in these challenging environments. This paper addresses an important aspect of deep RL related to situations that require multiple agents to communicate and cooperate to solve complex tasks. A survey of different approaches to problems related to multi-agent deep RL (MADRL) is presented, including non-stationarity, partial observability, continuous state and action spaces, multi-agent training schemes, multi-agent transfer learning. The merits and demerits of the reviewed methods will be analyzed and discussed, with their corresponding applications explored. It is envisaged that this review provides insights about various MADRL methods and can lead to future development of more robust and highly useful multi-agent learning methods for solving real-world problems.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"We explore deep reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent domains. We begin by analyzing the difficulty of traditional algorithms in the multi-agent case: Q-learning is challenged by an inherent non-stationarity of the environment, while policy gradient suffers from a variance that increases as the number of agents grows. We then present an adaptation of actor-critic methods that considers action policies of other agents and is able to successfully learn policies that require complex multi-agent coordination. Additionally, we introduce a training regimen utilizing an ensemble of policies for each agent that leads to more robust multi-agent policies. We show the strength of our approach compared to existing methods in cooperative as well as competitive scenarios, where agent populations are able to discover various physical and informational coordination strategies.",1
21,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"We consider a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem where each agent seeks to maximize a shared reward while interacting with other agents, and they may or may not be able to communicate. Typically the agents do not have access to other agent policies and thus each agent is situated in a non-stationary and partially-observable environment. In order to obtain multi-agents that act in a decentralized manner, we introduce a novel algorithm under the popular framework of centralized training, but decentralized execution. This training framework first obtains solutions to a multi-agent problem with a single centralized joint-space learner, which is then used to guide imitation learning for independent decentralized multi-agents. This framework has the flexibility to use any reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain the expert as well as any imitation learning algorithm to obtain the decentralized agents. This is in contrast to other multi-agent learning algorithms that, for example, can require more specific structures. We present some theoretical bounds for our method, and we show that one can obtain decentralized solutions to a multi-agent problem through imitation learning.",1

25,Multimodal generative adversarial networks for fake news detection from text and audio,"Social media are nowadays one of the main news sources for millions of people around the globe due to their low cost, easy access and rapid dissemination. This however comes at the cost of dubious trustworthiness and significant risk of exposure to 'fake news', intentionally written to mislead the readers. Automatically detecting fake news poses challenges that defy existing content-based analysis approaches. One of the main reasons is that often the interpretation of the news requires the knowledge of political or social context or 'common sense', which current NLP algorithms are still missing. Recent studies have shown that fake and real news spread differently on social media, forming propagation patterns that could be harnessed for the automatic fake news detection. Propagation-based approaches have multiple advantages compared to their content-based counterparts, among which is language independence and better resilience to adversarial attacks. In this paper we show a novel automatic fake news detection model based on geometric deep learning. The underlying core algorithms are a generalization of classical CNNs to graphs, allowing the fusion of heterogeneous data such as content, user profile and activity, social graph, and news propagation. Our model was trained and tested on news stories, verified by professional fact-checking organizations, that were spread on Twitter. Our experiments indicate that social network structure and propagation are important features allowing highly accurate (92.7% ROC AUC) fake news detection. Second, we observe that fake news can be reliably detected at an early stage, after just a few hours of propagation. Third, we test the aging of our model on training and testing data separated in time. Our results point to the promise of propagation-based approaches for fake news detection as an alternative or complementary strategy to content-based approaches.",1
43,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"Sentiment analysis, a popular technique for opinion mining, has been used by the software engineering research community for tasks such as assessing app reviews, developer emotions in issue trackers and developer opinions on APIs. Past research indicates that state-of-the-art sentiment analysis techniques have poor performance on SE data. This is because sentiment analysis tools are often designed to work on non-technical documents such as movie reviews. In this study, we attempt to solve the issues with existing sentiment analysis techniques for SE texts by proposing a hierarchical model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) trained on top of pre-trained word vectors. We assessed our model's performance and reliability by comparing it with a number of frequently used sentiment analysis tools on five gold standard datasets. Our results show that our model pushes the state of the art further on all datasets in terms of accuracy. We also show that it is possible to get better accuracy after labelling a small sample of the dataset and re-training our model rather than using an unsupervised classifier.",1

43,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"Sentiment polarity of tweets, blog posts or product reviews has become highly attractive and is utilized in recommender systems, market predictions, business intelligence and more. Deep learning techniques are becoming top performers on analyzing such texts. There are however several problems that need to be solved for efficient use of deep neural networks on text mining and text polarity analysis. First, deep neural networks need to be fed with data sets that are big in size as well as properly labeled. Second, there are various uncertainties regarding the use of word embedding vectors: should they be generated from the same data set that is used to train the model or it is better to source them from big and popular collections? Third, to simplify model creation it is convenient to have generic neural network architectures that are effective and can adapt to various texts, encapsulating much of design complexity. This thesis addresses the above problems to provide methodological and practical insights for utilizing neural networks on sentiment analysis of texts and achieving state of the art results. Regarding the first problem, the effectiveness of various crowdsourcing alternatives is explored and two medium-sized and emotion-labeled song data sets are created utilizing social tags. To address the second problem, a series of experiments with large text collections of various contents and domains were conducted, trying word embeddings of various parameters. Regarding the third problem, a series of experiments involving convolution and max-pooling neural layers were conducted. Combining convolutions of words, bigrams, and trigrams with regional max-pooling layers in a couple of stacks produced the best results. The derived architecture achieves competitive performance on sentiment polarity analysis of movie, business and product reviews.",1

We show how to use for this task the standard generative lan- guage models, which are slightly complementary to the state of the art techniques. We achieve strong results on a well-known dataset of IMDB movie reviews. Our results are easily reproducible, as we publish also the code needed to repeat the experiments.

43,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"This work investigates the role of factors like training method, training corpus size and thematic relevance of texts in the performance of word embedding features on sentiment analysis of tweets, song lyrics, movie reviews and item reviews. We also explore specific training or post-processing methods that can be used to enhance the performance of word embeddings in certain tasks or domains. Our empirical observations indicate that models trained with multithematic texts that are large and rich in vocabulary are the best in answering syntactic and semantic word analogy questions. We further observe that influence of thematic relevance is stronger on movie and phone reviews, but weaker on tweets and lyrics. These two later domains are more sensitive to corpus size and training method, with Glove outperforming Word2vec.

43,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"This paper describes a weakly supervised system for sentiment analysis in the movie review domain. The objective is to classify a movie review into a polarity class, positive or negative, based on those sentences bearing opinion on the movie alone. The irrelevant text, not directly related to the reviewer opinion on the movie, is left out of analysis. Wikipedia incorporates the world knowledge of movie-specific features in the system which is used to obtain an extractive summary of the review, consisting of the reviewer's opinions about the specific aspects of the movie. This filters out the concepts which are irrelevant or objective with respect to the given movie. The proposed system, WikiSent, does not require any labeled data for training. The only weak supervision arises out of the usage of resources like WordNet, Part-of-Speech Tagger and Sentiment Lexicons by virtue of their construction. WikiSent achieves a considerable accuracy improvement over the baseline and has a better or comparable accuracy to the existing semi-supervised and unsupervised systems in the domain, on the same dataset. We also perform a general movie review trend analysis using WikiSent to find the trend in movie-making and the public acceptance in terms of movie genre, year of release and polarity.",1
43,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"In order to maximize the applicability of sentiment analysis results, it is necessary to not only classify the overall sentiment (positive/negative) of a given document but also to identify the main words that contribute to the classification. However, most datasets for sentiment analysis only have the sentiment label for each document or sentence. In other words, there is no information about which words play an important role in sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying key words discriminating positive and negative sentences by using a weakly supervised learning method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In our model, each word is represented as a continuous-valued vector and each sentence is represented as a matrix whose rows correspond to the word vector used in the sentence. Then, the CNN model is trained using these sentence matrices as inputs and the sentiment labels as the output. Once the CNN model is trained, we implement the word attention mechanism that identifies high-contributing words to classification results with a class activation map, using the weights from the fully connected layer at the end of the learned CNN model. In order to verify the proposed methodology, we evaluated the classification accuracy and inclusion rate of polarity words using two movie review datasets. Experimental result show that the proposed model can not only correctly classify the sentence polarity but also successfully identify the corresponding words with high polarity scores.",1

We use statistical methods to capture elements of subjective style and the sentence polarity. The paper elaborately discusses two supervised machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbour(K-NN) and Naive Bayes and compares their overall accuracy, precisions as well as recall values. It was seen that in case of movie reviews Naive Bayes gave far better results than K-NN but for hotel reviews these algorithms gave lesser, almost same accuracies.",1
43,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"Our study employs sentiment analysis to evaluate the compatibility of Amazon.com reviews with their corresponding ratings. Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying and classifying the sentiment expressed in a piece of text as being positive or negative. On e-commerce websites such as Amazon.com, consumers can submit their reviews along with a specific polarity rating. In some instances, there is a mismatch between the review and the rating. To identify the reviews with mismatched ratings we performed sentiment analysis using deep learning on Amazon.com product review data. Product reviews were converted to vectors using paragraph vector, which then was used to train a recurrent neural network with gated recurrent unit. Our model incorporated both semantic relationship of review text and product information. We also developed a web service application that predicts the rating score for a submitted review using the trained model and if there is a mismatch between predicted rating score and submitted rating score, it provides feedback to the reviewer.",1
43,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"Despite the loss of semantic information, bag-of-ngram based methods still achieve state-of-the-art results for tasks such as sentiment classification of long movie reviews. Many document embeddings methods have been proposed to capture semantics, but they still can't outperform bag-of-ngram based methods on this task. In this paper, we modify the architecture of the recently proposed Paragraph Vector, allowing it to learn document vectors by predicting not only words, but n-gram features as well. Our model is able to capture both semantics and word order in documents while keeping the expressive power of learned vectors. Experimental results on IMDB movie review dataset shows that our model outperforms previous deep learning models and bag-of-ngram based models due to the above advantages.

However, limited work has been conducted to apply deep learning algorithms to languages other than English, such as Persian. In this work, two deep learning models (deep autoencoders and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)) are developed and applied to a novel Persian movie reviews dataset. The proposed deep learning models are analyzed and compared with the state-of-the-art shallow multilayer perceptron (MLP) based machine learning model. Simulation results demonstrate the enhanced performance of deep learning over state-of-the-art MLP.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Transfer-learning and meta-learning are two effective methods to apply knowledge learned from large data sources to new tasks. In few-class, few-shot target task settings (i.e. when there are only a few classes and training examples available in the target task), meta-learning approaches that optimize for future task learning have outperformed the typical transfer approach of initializing model weights from a pre-trained starting point. But as we experimentally show, meta-learning algorithms that work well in the few-class setting do not generalize well in many-shot and many-class cases. In this paper, we propose a joint training approach that combines both transfer-learning and meta-learning. Benefiting from the advantages of each, our method obtains improved generalization performance on unseen target tasks in both few- and many-class and few- and many-shot scenarios.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Gradient-based meta-learning techniques are both widely applicable and proficient at solving challenging few-shot learning and fast adaptation problems. However, they have practical difficulties when operating on high-dimensional parameter spaces in extreme low-data regimes. We show that it is possible to bypass these limitations by learning a data-dependent latent generative representation of model parameters, and performing gradient-based meta-learning in this low-dimensional latent space. The resulting approach, latent embedding optimization (LEO), decouples the gradient-based adaptation procedure from the underlying high-dimensional space of model parameters. Our evaluation shows that LEO can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the competitive miniImageNet and tieredImageNet few-shot classification tasks. Further analysis indicates LEO is able to capture uncertainty in the data, and can perform adaptation more effectively by optimizing in latent space.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of applying few-shot learning algorithms to a speech task. We formulate a user-defined scenario of spoken term classification as a few-shot learning problem. In most few-shot learning studies, it is assumed that all the N classes are new in a N-way problem. We suggest that this assumption can be relaxed and define a N+M-way problem where N and M are the number of new classes and fixed classes respectively. We propose a modification to the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm to solve the problem. Experiments on the Google Speech Commands dataset show that our approach outperforms the conventional supervised learning approach and the original MAML.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Few-shot Learning aims to learn classifiers for new classes with only a few training examples per class. Existing meta-learning or metric-learning based few-shot learning approaches are limited in handling diverse domains with various number of labels. The meta-learning approaches train a meta learner to predict weights of homogeneous-structured task-specific networks, requiring a uniform number of classes across tasks. The metric-learning approaches learn one task-invariant metric for all the tasks, and they fail if the tasks diverge. We propose to deal with these limitations with meta metric learning. Our meta metric learning approach consists of task-specific learners, that exploit metric learning to handle flexible labels, and a meta learner, that discovers good parameters and gradient decent to specify the metrics in task-specific learners. Thus the proposed model is able to handle unbalanced classes as well as to generate task-specific metrics. We test our approach in the `$k$-shot $N$-way' few-shot learning setting used in previous work and new realistic few-shot setting with diverse multi-domain tasks and flexible label numbers. Experiments show that our approach attains superior performances in both settings.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Few-shot classification consists of learning a predictive model that is able to effectively adapt to a new class, given only a few annotated samples. To solve this challenging problem, meta-learning has become a popular paradigm that advocates the ability to ""learn to adapt"". Recent works have shown, however, that simple learning strategies without meta-learning could be competitive. In this paper, we go a step further and show that by addressing the fundamental high-variance issue of few-shot learning classifiers, it is possible to significantly outperform current meta-learning techniques. Our approach consists of designing an ensemble of deep networks to leverage the variance of the classifiers, and introducing new strategies to encourage the networks to cooperate, while encouraging prediction diversity. Evaluation is conducted on the mini-ImageNet and CUB datasets, where we show that even a single network obtained by distillation yields state-of-the-art results.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"The field of few-shot learning has recently seen substantial advancements. Most of these advancements came from casting few-shot learning as a meta-learning problem. Model Agnostic Meta Learning or MAML is currently one of the best approaches for few-shot learning via meta-learning. MAML is simple, elegant and very powerful, however, it has a variety of issues, such as being very sensitive to neural network architectures, often leading to instability during training, requiring arduous hyperparameter searches to stabilize training and achieve high generalization and being very computationally expensive at both training and inference times. In this paper, we propose various modifications to MAML that not only stabilize the system, but also substantially improve the generalization performance, convergence speed and computational overhead of MAML, which we call MAML++.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Few-shot classification refers to learning a classifier for new classes given only a few examples. While a plethora of models have emerged to tackle it, we find the procedure and datasets that are used to assess their progress lacking. To address this limitation, we propose Meta-Dataset: a new benchmark for training and evaluating models that is large-scale, consists of diverse datasets, and presents more realistic tasks. We experiment with popular baselines and meta-learners on Meta-Dataset, along with a competitive method that we propose. We analyze performance as a function of various characteristics of test tasks and examine the models' ability to leverage diverse training sources for improving their generalization. We also propose a new set of baselines for quantifying the benefit of meta-learning in Meta-Dataset. Our extensive experimentation has uncovered important research challenges and we hope to inspire work in these directions.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"We study few-shot learning in natural language domains. Compared to many existing works that apply either metric-based or optimization-based meta-learning to image domain with low inter-task variance, we consider a more realistic setting, where tasks are diverse. However, it imposes tremendous difficulties to existing state-of-the-art metric-based algorithms since a single metric is insufficient to capture complex task variations in natural language domain. To alleviate the problem, we propose an adaptive metric learning approach that automatically determines the best weighted combination from a set of metrics obtained from meta-training tasks for a newly seen few-shot task. Extensive quantitative evaluations on real-world sentiment analysis and dialog intent classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art few shot learning algorithms in terms of predictive accuracy. We make our code and data available for further study.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Learning good feature embeddings for images often requires substantial training data. As a consequence, in settings where training data is limited (e.g., few-shot and zero-shot learning), we are typically forced to use a generic feature embedding across various tasks. Ideally, we want to construct feature embeddings that are tuned for the given task. In this work, we propose Task-Aware Feature Embedding Networks (TAFE-Nets) to learn how to adapt the image representation to a new task in a meta learning fashion. Our network is composed of a meta learner and a prediction network. Based on a task input, the meta learner generates parameters for the feature layers in the prediction network so that the feature embedding can be accurately adjusted for that task. We show that TAFE-Net is highly effective in generalizing to new tasks or concepts and evaluate the TAFE-Net on a range of benchmarks in zero-shot and few-shot learning. Our model matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art on all tasks. In particular, our approach improves the prediction accuracy of unseen attribute-object pairs by 4 to 15 points on the challenging visual attribute-object composition task.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Meta-learning has been proposed as a framework to address the challenging few-shot learning setting. The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, meta-learning typically uses shallow neural networks (SNNs), thus limiting its effectiveness. In this paper we propose a novel few-shot learning method called meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to adapt a deep NN for few shot learning tasks. Specifically, ""meta"" refers to training multiple tasks, and ""transfer"" is achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum for MTL. We conduct experiments using (5-class, 1-shot) and (5-class, 5-shot) recognition tasks on two challenging few-shot learning benchmarks: miniImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100. Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our meta-transfer learning approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both components contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Traditional recognition methods typically require large, artificially-balanced training classes, while few-shot learning methods are tested on artificially small ones. In contrast to both extremes, real world recognition problems exhibit heavy-tailed class distributions, with cluttered scenes and a mix of coarse and fine-grained class distinctions. We show that prior methods designed for few-shot learning do not work out of the box in these challenging conditions, based on a new ""meta-iNat"" benchmark. We introduce three parameter-free improvements: (a) better training procedures based on adapting cross-validation to meta-learning, (b) novel architectures that localize objects using limited bounding box annotations before classification, and (c) simple parameter-free expansions of the feature space based on bilinear pooling. Together, these improvements double the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on meta-iNat while generalizing to prior benchmarks, complex neural architectures, and settings with substantial domain shift.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Metric-based meta-learning techniques have successfully been applied to few-shot classification problems. In this paper, we propose to leverage cross-modal information to enhance metric-based few-shot learning methods. Visual and semantic feature spaces have different structures by definition. For certain concepts, visual features might be richer and more discriminative than text ones. While for others, the inverse might be true. Moreover, when the support from visual information is limited in image classification, semantic representations (learned from unsupervised text corpora) can provide strong prior knowledge and context to help learning. Based on these two intuitions, we propose a mechanism that can adaptively combine information from both modalities according to new image categories to be learned. Through a series of experiments, we show that by this adaptive combination of the two modalities, our model outperforms current uni-modality few-shot learning methods and modality-alignment methods by a large margin on all benchmarks and few-shot scenarios tested. Experiments also show that our model can effectively adjust its focus on the two modalities. The improvement in performance is particularly large when the number of shots is very small.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"The field of few-shot learning has been laboriously explored in the supervised setting, where per-class labels are available. On the other hand, the unsupervised few-shot learning setting, where no labels of any kind are required, has seen little investigation. We propose a method, named Assume, Augment and Learn or AAL, for generating few-shot tasks using unlabeled data. We randomly label a random subset of images from an unlabeled dataset to generate a support set. Then by applying data augmentation on the support set's images, and reusing the support set's labels, we obtain a target set. The resulting few-shot tasks can be used to train any standard meta-learning framework. Once trained, such a model, can be directly applied on small real-labeled datasets without any changes or fine-tuning required. In our experiments, the learned models achieve good generalization performance in a variety of established few-shot learning tasks on Omniglot and Mini-Imagenet.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Few-shot learning remains challenging for meta-learning that learns a learning algorithm (meta-learner) from many related tasks. In this work, we argue that this is due to the lack of a good representation for meta-learning, and propose deep meta-learning to integrate the representation power of deep learning into meta-learning. The framework is composed of three modules, a concept generator, a meta-learner, and a concept discriminator, which are learned jointly. The concept generator, e.g. a deep residual net, extracts a representation for each instance that captures its high-level concept, on which the meta-learner performs few-shot learning, and the concept discriminator recognizes the concepts. By learning to learn in the concept space rather than in the complicated instance space, deep meta-learning can substantially improve vanilla meta-learning, which is demonstrated on various few-shot image recognition problems. For example, on 5-way-1-shot image recognition on CIFAR-100 and CUB-200, it improves Matching Nets from 50.53% and 56.53% to 58.18% and 63.47%, improves MAML from 49.28% and 50.45% to 56.65% and 64.63%, and improves Meta-SGD from 53.83% and 53.34% to 61.62% and 66.95%, respectively.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Few-shot learning focuses on learning a new visual concept with very limited labelled examples. A successful approach to tackle this problem is to compare the similarity between examples in a learned metric space based on convolutional neural networks. However, existing methods typically suffer from meta-level overfitting due to the limited amount of training tasks and do not normally consider the importance of the convolutional features of different examples within the same channel. To address these limitations, we make the following two contributions: (a) We propose a novel meta-learning approach for aggregating useful convolutional features and suppressing noisy ones based on a channel-wise attention mechanism to improve class representations. The proposed model does not require fine-tuning and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. The main novelty lies in incorporating a shared weight generation module that learns to assign different weights to the feature maps of different examples within the same channel. (b) We also introduce a simple meta-level dropout technique that reduces meta-level overfitting in several few-shot learning approaches. In our experiments, we find that this simple technique significantly improves the performance of the proposed method as well as various state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithms. Applying our method to few-shot image recognition using Omniglot and miniImageNet datasets shows that it is capable of delivering a state-of-the-art classification performance.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Meta-learning for few-shot learning entails acquiring a prior over previous tasks and experiences, such that new tasks be learned from small amounts of data. However, a critical challenge in few-shot learning is task ambiguity: even when a powerful prior can be meta-learned from a large number of prior tasks, a small dataset for a new task can simply be too ambiguous to acquire a single model (e.g., a classifier) for that task that is accurate. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic meta-learning algorithm that can sample models for a new task from a model distribution. Our approach extends model-agnostic meta-learning, which adapts to new tasks via gradient descent, to incorporate a parameter distribution that is trained via a variational lower bound. At meta-test time, our algorithm adapts via a simple procedure that injects noise into gradient descent, and at meta-training time, the model is trained such that this stochastic adaptation procedure produces samples from the approximate model posterior. Our experimental results show that our method can sample plausible classifiers and regressors in ambiguous few-shot learning problems. We also show how reasoning about ambiguity can also be used for downstream active learning problems.",1
48,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Meta learning is a promising solution to few-shot learning problems. However, existing meta learning methods are restricted to the scenarios where training and application tasks share the same out-put structure. To obtain a meta model applicable to the tasks with new structures, it is required to collect new training data and repeat the time-consuming meta training procedure. This makes them inefficient or even inapplicable in learning to solve heterogeneous few-shot learning tasks. We thus develop a novel and principled HierarchicalMeta Learning (HML) method. Different from existing methods that only focus on optimizing the adaptability of a meta model to similar tasks, HML also explicitly optimizes its generalizability across heterogeneous tasks. To this end, HML first factorizes a set of similar training tasks into heterogeneous ones and trains the meta model over them at two levels to maximize adaptation and generalization performance respectively. The resultant model can then directly generalize to new tasks. Extensive experiments on few-shot classification and regression problems clearly demonstrate the superiority of HML over fine-tuning and state-of-the-art meta learning approaches in terms of generalization across heterogeneous tasks.",1
53,Exploring the use of BERT-based architectures for named entity recognition.,"Traditional information retrieval treats named entity recognition as a pre-indexing corpus annotation task, allowing entity tags to be indexed and used during search. Named entity taggers themselves are typically trained on thousands or tens of thousands of examples labeled by humans.   However, there is a long tail of named entities classes, and for these cases, labeled data may be impossible to find or justify financially. We propose exploring named entity recognition as a search task, where the named entity class of interest is a query, and entities of that class are the relevant ""documents"". What should that query look like? Can we even perform NER-style labeling with tens of labels? This study presents an exploration of CRF-based NER models with handcrafted features and of how we might transform them into search queries.",1
57,Attention mechanisms for question answering on long-form texts.,"Recurrent neural networks are now the state-of-the-art in natural language processing because they can build rich contextual representations and process texts of arbitrary length. However, recent developments on attention mechanisms have equipped feedforward networks with similar capabilities, hence enabling faster computations due to the increase in the number of operations that can be parallelized. We explore this new type of architecture in the domain of question-answering and propose a novel approach that we call Fully Attention Based Information Retriever (FABIR). We show that FABIR achieves competitive results in the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) while having fewer parameters and being faster at both learning and inference than rival methods.",1
57,Attention mechanisms for question answering on long-form texts.,"Recently, the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task has gained increasing attention in artificial intelligence. Existing VQA methods mainly adopt the visual attention mechanism to associate the input question with corresponding image regions for effective question answering. The free-form region based and the detection-based visual attention mechanisms are mostly investigated, with the former ones attending free-form image regions and the latter ones attending pre-specified detection-box regions. We argue that the two attention mechanisms are able to provide complementary information and should be effectively integrated to better solve the VQA problem. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network for VQA that integrates both attention mechanisms. Our proposed framework effectively fuses features from free-form image regions, detection boxes, and question representations via a multi-modal multiplicative feature embedding scheme to jointly attend question-related free-form image regions and detection boxes for more accurate question answering. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on two publicly available datasets, COCO-QA and VQA, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

61,Improving text classification using attention and memory-augmented networks.,"In this paper, we exploit a memory-augmented neural network to predict accurate answers to visual questions, even when those answers occur rarely in the training set. The memory network incorporates both internal and external memory blocks and selectively pays attention to each training exemplar. We show that memory-augmented neural networks are able to maintain a relatively long-term memory of scarce training exemplars, which is important for visual question answering due to the heavy-tailed distribution of answers in a general VQA setting. Experimental results on two large-scale benchmark datasets show the favorable performance of the proposed algorithm with a comparison to state of the art.",1

NSE is equipped with a novel memory update rule and has a variable sized encoding memory that evolves over time and maintains the understanding of input sequences through read}, compose and write operations. NSE can also access multiple and shared memories. In this paper, we demonstrated the effectiveness and the flexibility of NSE on five different natural language tasks: natural language inference, question answering, sentence classification, document sentiment analysis and machine translation where NSE achieved state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on publically available benchmarks. For example, our shared-memory model showed an encouraging result on neural machine translation, improving an attention-based baseline by approximately 1.0 BLEU.",1
61,Improving text classification using attention and memory-augmented networks.,"We perform text normalization, i.e. the transformation of words from the written to the spoken form, using a memory augmented neural network. With the addition of dynamic memory access and storage mechanism, we present a neural architecture that will serve as a language-agnostic text normalization system while avoiding the kind of unacceptable errors made by the LSTM-based recurrent neural networks. By successfully reducing the frequency of such mistakes, we show that this novel architecture is indeed a better alternative. Our proposed system requires significantly lesser amounts of data, training time and compute resources. Additionally, we perform data up-sampling, circumventing the data sparsity problem in some semiotic classes, to show that sufficient examples in any particular class can improve the performance of our text normalization system. Although a few occurrences of these errors still remain in certain semiotic classes, we demonstrate that memory augmented networks with meta-learning capabilities can open many doors to a superior text normalization system.",1
72,Deep learning approaches for part-of-speech tagging on large datasets.,Sparsity is one of the major problems in natural language processing. The problem becomes even more severe in agglutinating languages that are highly prone to be inflected. We deal with sparsity in Turkish by adopting morphological features for part-of-speech tagging. We learn inflectional and derivational morpheme tags in Turkish by using conditional random fields (CRF) and we employ the morpheme tags in part-of-speech (PoS) tagging by using hidden Markov models (HMMs) to mitigate sparsity. Results show that using morpheme tags in PoS tagging helps alleviate the sparsity in emission probabilities. Our model outperforms other hidden Markov model based PoS tagging models for small training datasets in Turkish. We obtain an accuracy of 94.1% in morpheme tagging and 89.2% in PoS tagging on a 5K training dataset.,1
72,Deep learning approaches for part-of-speech tagging on large datasets.,"Morphologically rich languages often lack the annotated linguistic resources required to develop accurate natural language processing tools. We propose models suitable for training morphological taggers with rich tagsets for low-resource languages without using direct supervision. Our approach extends existing approaches of projecting part-of-speech tags across languages, using bitext to infer constraints on the possible tags for a given word type or token. We propose a tagging model using Wsabie, a discriminative embedding-based model with rank-based learning. In our evaluation on 11 languages, on average this model performs on par with a baseline weakly-supervised HMM, while being more scalable. Multilingual experiments show that the method performs best when projecting between related language pairs. Despite the inherently lossy projection, we show that the morphological tags predicted by our models improve the downstream performance of a parser by +0.6 LAS on average.",1
72,Deep learning approaches for part-of-speech tagging on large datasets.,"Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (BLSTM-RNN) has been shown to be very effective for modeling and predicting sequential data, e.g. speech utterances or handwritten documents. In this study, we propose to use BLSTM-RNN for a unified tagging solution that can be applied to various tagging tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking and named entity recognition. Instead of exploiting specific features carefully optimized for each task, our solution only uses one set of task-independent features and internal representations learnt from unlabeled text for all tasks.Requiring no task specific knowledge or sophisticated feature engineering, our approach gets nearly state-of-the-art performance in all these three tagging tasks.",1

The approach is simple, yet surprisingly effective, resulting in a new state of the art without access to any gold annotated data.",1
72,Deep learning approaches for part-of-speech tagging on large datasets.,"Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a process of assigning the words in a text corresponding to a particular part of speech. A fundamental version of POS tagging is the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives etc. For processing natural languages, Part of Speech tagging is a prominent tool. It is one of the simplest as well as most constant and statistical model for many NLP applications. POS Tagging is an initial stage of linguistics, text analysis like information retrieval, machine translator, text to speech synthesis, information extraction etc. In POS Tagging we assign a Part of Speech tag to each word in a sentence and literature. Various approaches have been proposed to implement POS taggers. In this paper we present a Marathi part of speech tagger. It is morphologically rich language. Marathi is spoken by the native people of Maharashtra. The general approach used for development of tagger is statistical using Unigram, Bigram, Trigram and HMM Methods. It presents a clear idea about all the algorithms with suitable examples. It also introduces a tag set for Marathi which can be used for tagging Marathi text. In this paper we have shown the development of the tagger as well as compared to check the accuracy of taggers output. The three Marathi POS taggers viz. Unigram, Bigram, Trigram and HMM gives the accuracy of 77.38%, 90.30%, 91.46% and 93.82% respectively.",1

We evaluate the tagset both intrinsically on the new task of semantic tagging, as well as on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. Our system, consisting of a ResNet and an auxiliary loss function predicting our semantic tags, significantly outperforms prior results on English Universal Dependencies POS tagging (95.71% accuracy on UD v1.2 and 95.67% accuracy on UD v1.3).",1
72,Deep learning approaches for part-of-speech tagging on large datasets.,"The rise of neural networks, and particularly recurrent neural networks, has produced significant advances in part-of-speech tagging accuracy. One characteristic common among these models is the presence of rich initial word encodings. These encodings typically are composed of a recurrent character-based representation with learned and pre-trained word embeddings. However, these encodings do not consider a context wider than a single word and it is only through subsequent recurrent layers that word or sub-word information interacts. In this paper, we investigate models that use recurrent neural networks with sentence-level context for initial character and word-based representations. In particular we show that optimal results are obtained by integrating these context sensitive representations through synchronized training with a meta-model that learns to combine their states. We present results on part-of-speech and morphological tagging with state-of-the-art performance on a number of languages.",1
72,Deep learning approaches for part-of-speech tagging on large datasets.,"In this paper, we are going to focus on speed up of the Word Sense Disambiguation procedure by filtering the relevant senses of an ambiguous word through Part-of-Speech Tagging. First, this proposed approach performs the Part-of-Speech Tagging operation before the disambiguation procedure using Bigram approximation. As a result, the exact Part-of-Speech of the ambiguous word at a particular text instance is derived. In the next stage, only those dictionary definitions (glosses) are retrieved from an online dictionary, which are associated with that particular Part-of-Speech to disambiguate the exact sense of the ambiguous word. In the training phase, we have used Brown Corpus for Part-of-Speech Tagging and WordNet as an online dictionary. The proposed approach reduces the execution time upto half (approximately) of the normal execution time for a text, containing around 200 sentences. Not only that, we have found several instances, where the correct sense of an ambiguous word is found for using the Part-of-Speech Tagging before the Disambiguation procedure.",1
74,Recent trends in transformer-based architectures for question answering.,"Recent years have seen growing interest in conversational agents, such as chatbots, which are a very good fit for automated customer support because the domain in which they need to operate is narrow. This interest was in part inspired by recent advances in neural machine translation, esp. the rise of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) and attention-based models such as the Transformer, which have been applied to various other tasks and have opened new research directions in question answering, chatbots, and conversational systems. Still, in many cases, it might be feasible and even preferable to use simple information retrieval techniques. Thus, here we compare three different models:(i) a retrieval model, (ii) a sequence-to-sequence model with attention, and (iii) Transformer. Our experiments with the Twitter Customer Support Dataset, which contains over two million posts from customer support services of twenty major brands, show that the seq2seq model outperforms the other two in terms of semantics and word overlap.",1
74,Recent trends in transformer-based architectures for question answering.,"The task of answering natural language questions over knowledge bases has received wide attention in recent years. Various deep learning architectures have been proposed for this task. However, architectural design choices are typically not systematically compared nor evaluated under the same conditions. In this paper, we contribute to a better understanding of the impact of architectural design choices by evaluating four different architectures under the same conditions. We address the task of answering simple questions, consisting in predicting the subject and predicate of a triple given a question. In order to provide a fair comparison of different architectures, we evaluate them under the same strategy for inferring the subject, and compare different architectures for inferring the predicate. The architecture for inferring the subject is based on a standard LSTM model trained to recognize the span of the subject in the question and on a linking component that links the subject span to an entity in the knowledge base. The architectures for predicate inference are based on i) a standard softmax classifier ranging over all predicates as output, iii) a model that predicts a low-dimensional encoding of the property given entity representation and question, iii) a model that learns to score a pair of subject and predicate given the question as well as iv) a model based on the well-known FastText model. The comparison of architectures shows that FastText provides better results than other architectures.",1
86,Multilingual speech-to-text systems for Asian languages,"Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are becoming popular in multilingual societies. This trend induces portmanteau of South Asian languages with English. The blend of multiple languages as code-mixed data has recently become popular in research communities for various NLP tasks. Code-mixed data consist of anomalies such as grammatical errors and spelling variations. In this paper, we leverage the contextual property of words where the different spelling variation of words share similar context in a large noisy social media text. We capture different variations of words belonging to same context in an unsupervised manner using distributed representations of words. Our experiments reveal that preprocessing of the code-mixed dataset based on our approach improves the performance in state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagging (POS-tagging) and sentiment analysis tasks.",1
86,Multilingual speech-to-text systems for Asian languages,"We present two end-to-end models: Audio-to-Byte (A2B) and Byte-to-Audio (B2A), for multilingual speech recognition and synthesis. Prior work has predominantly used characters, sub-words or words as the unit of choice to model text. These units are difficult to scale to languages with large vocabularies, particularly in the case of multilingual processing. In this work, we model text via a sequence of Unicode bytes, specifically, the UTF-8 variable length byte sequence for each character. Bytes allow us to avoid large softmaxes in languages with large vocabularies, and share representations in multilingual models. We show that bytes are superior to grapheme characters over a wide variety of languages in monolingual end-to-end speech recognition. Additionally, our multilingual byte model outperform each respective single language baseline on average by 4.4% relatively. In Japanese-English code-switching speech, our multilingual byte model outperform our monolingual baseline by 38.6% relatively. Finally, we present an end-to-end multilingual speech synthesis model using byte representations which matches the performance of our monolingual baselines.",1
90,Efficient methods for computing similarity between embeddings,"We develop a family of techniques to align word embeddings which are derived from different source datasets or created using different mechanisms (e.g., GloVe or word2vec). Our methods are simple and have a closed form to optimally rotate, translate, and scale to minimize root mean squared errors or maximize the average cosine similarity between two embeddings of the same vocabulary into the same dimensional space. Our methods extend approaches known as Absolute Orientation, which are popular for aligning objects in three-dimensions, and generalize an approach by Smith etal (ICLR 2017). We prove new results for optimal scaling and for maximizing cosine similarity. Then we demonstrate how to evaluate the similarity of embeddings from different sources or mechanisms, and that certain properties like synonyms and analogies are preserved across the embeddings and can be enhanced by simply aligning and averaging ensembles of embeddings.",1
90,Efficient methods for computing similarity between embeddings,"We present a family of neural-network--inspired models for computing continuous word representations, specifically designed to exploit both monolingual and multilingual text. This framework allows us to perform unsupervised training of embeddings that exhibit higher accuracy on syntactic and semantic compositionality, as well as multilingual semantic similarity, compared to previous models trained in an unsupervised fashion. We also show that such multilingual embeddings, optimized for semantic similarity, can improve the performance of statistical machine translation with respect to how it handles words not present in the parallel data.",1
90,Efficient methods for computing similarity between embeddings,"Neural network techniques are widely applied to obtain high-quality distributed representations of words, i.e., word embeddings, to address text mining, information retrieval, and natural language processing tasks. Recently, efficient methods have been proposed to learn word embeddings from context that captures both semantic and syntactic relationships between words. However, it is challenging to handle unseen words or rare words with insufficient context. In this paper, inspired by the study on word recognition process in cognitive psychology, we propose to take advantage of seemingly less obvious but essentially important morphological knowledge to address these challenges. In particular, we introduce a novel neural network architecture called KNET that leverages both contextual information and morphological word similarity built based on morphological knowledge to learn word embeddings. Meanwhile, the learning architecture is also able to refine the pre-defined morphological knowledge and obtain more accurate word similarity. Experiments on an analogical reasoning task and a word similarity task both demonstrate that the proposed KNET framework can greatly enhance the effectiveness of word embeddings.",1
90,Efficient methods for computing similarity between embeddings,"Embedding a web-scale information network into a low-dimensional vector space facilitates tasks such as link prediction, classification, and visualization. Past research has addressed the problem of extracting such embeddings by adopting methods from words to graphs, without defining a clearly comprehensible graph-related objective. Yet, as we show, the objectives used in past works implicitly utilize similarity measures among graph nodes.   In this paper, we carry the similarity orientation of previous works to its logical conclusion; we propose VERtex Similarity Embeddings (VERSE), a simple, versatile, and memory-efficient method that derives graph embeddings explicitly calibrated to preserve the distributions of a selected vertex-to-vertex similarity measure. VERSE learns such embeddings by training a single-layer neural network. While its default, scalable version does so via sampling similarity information, we also develop a variant using the full information per vertex. Our experimental study on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrates that VERSE, instantiated with diverse similarity measures, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall in major data mining tasks and supersedes them in time and space efficiency, while the scalable sampling-based variant achieves equally good results as the non-scalable full variant.",1
90,Efficient methods for computing similarity between embeddings,"We suggest a loss for learning deep embeddings. The new loss does not introduce parameters that need to be tuned and results in very good embeddings across a range of datasets and problems. The loss is computed by estimating two distribution of similarities for positive (matching) and negative (non-matching) sample pairs, and then computing the probability of a positive pair to have a lower similarity score than a negative pair based on the estimated similarity distributions. We show that such operations can be performed in a simple and piecewise-differentiable manner using 1D histograms with soft assignment operations. This makes the proposed loss suitable for learning deep embeddings using stochastic optimization. In the experiments, the new loss performs favourably compared to recently proposed alternatives.",1

Concretely, we combine convolution, recurrent and attention modules with ensemble methods and show that they are complementary. We introduce ECGA, an end-to-end go-to architecture for novel text classification tasks. We prove that it is efficient and robust, as it attains or surpasses the state-of-the-art on varied datasets, including both low and high data regimes.",1
91,Low-complexity models for text classification tasks,"Classification tasks are usually analysed and improved through new model architectures or hyperparameter optimisation but the underlying properties of datasets are discovered on an ad-hoc basis as errors occur. However, understanding the properties of the data is crucial in perfecting models. In this paper we analyse exactly which characteristics of a dataset best determine how difficult that dataset is for the task of text classification. We then propose an intuitive measure of difficulty for text classification datasets which is simple and fast to calculate. We show that this measure generalises to unseen data by comparing it to state-of-the-art datasets and results. This measure can be used to analyse the precise source of errors in a dataset and allows fast estimation of how difficult a dataset is to learn. We searched for this measure by training 12 classical and neural network based models on 78 real-world datasets, then use a genetic algorithm to discover the best measure of difficulty.

91,Low-complexity models for text classification tasks,"Even as pre-trained language encoders such as BERT are shared across many tasks, the output layers of question answering, text classification, and regression models are significantly different. Span decoders are frequently used for question answering, fixed-class, classification layers for text classification, and similarity-scoring layers for regression tasks, We show that this distinction is not necessary and that all three can be unified as span extraction. A unified, span-extraction approach leads to superior or comparable performance in supplementary supervised pre-trained, low-data, and multi-task learning experiments on several question answering, text classification, and regression benchmarks.",1
93,Fast algorithms for solving linear regression problems,In this note we propose a new approach towards solving numerically optimal stopping problems via reinforced regression based Monte Carlo algorithms. The main idea of the method is to reinforce standard linear regression algorithms in each backward induction step by adding new basis functions based on previously estimated continuation values. The proposed methodology is illustrated by a numerical example from mathematical finance.,1
93,Fast algorithms for solving linear regression problems,"In recent years, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods and randomized linear algebra (RLA) algorithms have been applied to many large-scale problems in machine learning and data analysis. We aim to bridge the gap between these two methods in solving constrained overdetermined linear regression problems---e.g., $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ regression problems. We propose a hybrid algorithm named pwSGD that uses RLA techniques for preconditioning and constructing an importance sampling distribution, and then performs an SGD-like iterative process with weighted sampling on the preconditioned system. We prove that pwSGD inherits faster convergence rates that only depend on the lower dimension of the linear system, while maintaining low computation complexity. Particularly, when solving $\ell_1$ regression with size $n$ by $d$, pwSGD returns an approximate solution with $\epsilon$ relative error in the objective value in $\mathcal{O}(\log n \cdot \text{nnz}(A) + \text{poly}(d)/\epsilon^2)$ time. This complexity is uniformly better than that of RLA methods in terms of both $\epsilon$ and $d$ when the problem is unconstrained. For $\ell_2$ regression, pwSGD returns an approximate solution with $\epsilon$ relative error in the objective value and the solution vector measured in prediction norm in $\mathcal{O}(\log n \cdot \text{nnz}(A) + \text{poly}(d) \log(1/\epsilon) /\epsilon)$ time. We also provide lower bounds on the coreset complexity for more general regression problems, indicating that still new ideas will be needed to extend similar RLA preconditioning ideas to weighted SGD algorithms for more general regression problems. Finally, the effectiveness of such algorithms is illustrated numerically on both synthetic and real datasets.",1
93,Fast algorithms for solving linear regression problems,"We describe a fast method to eliminate features (variables) in l1 -penalized least-square regression (or LASSO) problems. The elimination of features leads to a potentially substantial reduction in running time, specially for large values of the penalty parameter. Our method is not heuristic: it only eliminates features that are guaranteed to be absent after solving the LASSO problem. The feature elimination step is easy to parallelize and can test each feature for elimination independently. Moreover, the computational effort of our method is negligible compared to that of solving the LASSO problem - roughly it is the same as single gradient step. Our method extends the scope of existing LASSO algorithms to treat larger data sets, previously out of their reach. We show how our method can be extended to general l1 -penalized convex problems and present preliminary results for the Sparse Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression problems.",1
93,Fast algorithms for solving linear regression problems,"This paper presents a fast approach for penalized least squares (LS) regression problems using a 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) prior. More precisely, the computation of the proximity operator of the LS criterion regularized by different GMRF potentials is formulated as solving a Sylvester-like matrix equation. By exploiting the structural properties of GMRFs, this matrix equation is solved columnwise in an analytical way. The proposed algorithm can be embedded into a wide range of proximal algorithms to solve LS regression problems including a convex penalty. Experiments carried out in the case of a constrained LS regression problem arising in a multichannel image processing application, provide evidence that an alternating direction method of multipliers performs quite efficiently in this context.",1

93,Fast algorithms for solving linear regression problems,"We give improved algorithms for the $\ell_{p}$-regression problem, $\min_{x} \|x\|_{p}$ such that $A x=b,$ for all $p \in (1,2) \cup (2,\infty).$ Our algorithms obtain a high accuracy solution in $\tilde{O}_{p}(m^{\frac{|p-2|}{2p + |p-2|}}) \le \tilde{O}_{p}(m^{\frac{1}{3}})$ iterations, where each iteration requires solving an $m \times m$ linear system, $m$ being the dimension of the ambient space.   By maintaining an approximate inverse of the linear systems that we solve in each iteration, we give algorithms for solving $\ell_{p}$-regression to $1 / \text{poly}(n)$ accuracy that run in time $\tilde{O}_p(m^{\max\{\omega, 7/3\}}),$ where $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication constant. For the current best value of $\omega > 2.37$, we can thus solve $\ell_{p}$ regression as fast as $\ell_{2}$ regression, for all constant $p$ bounded away from $1.$   Our algorithms can be combined with fast graph Laplacian linear equation solvers to give minimum $\ell_{p}$-norm flow / voltage solutions to $1 / \text{poly}(n)$ accuracy on an undirected graph with $m$ edges in $\tilde{O}_{p}(m^{1 + \frac{|p-2|}{2p + |p-2|}}) \le \tilde{O}_{p}(m^{\frac{4}{3}})$ time.   For sparse graphs and for matrices with similar dimensions, our iteration counts and running times improve on the $p$-norm regression algorithm by [Bubeck-Cohen-Lee-Li STOC`18] and general-purpose convex optimization algorithms. At the core of our algorithms is an iterative refinement scheme for $\ell_{p}$-norms, using the smoothed $\ell_{p}$-norms introduced in the work of Bubeck et al. Given an initial solution, we construct a problem that seeks to minimize a quadratically-smoothed $\ell_{p}$ norm over a subspace, such that a crude solution to this problem allows us to improve the initial solution by a constant factor, leading to algorithms with fast convergence.",1
95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"We present a framework for similarity search based on Locality-Sensitive Filtering (LSF), generalizing the Indyk-Motwani (STOC 1998) Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) framework to support space-time tradeoffs. Given a family of filters, defined as a distribution over pairs of subsets of space with certain locality-sensitivity properties, we can solve the approximate near neighbor problem in $d$-dimensional space for an $n$-point data set with query time $dn^{\rho_q+o(1)}$, update time $dn^{\rho_u+o(1)}$, and space usage $dn + n^{1 + \rho_u + o(1)}$. The space-time tradeoff is tied to the tradeoff between query time and update time, controlled by the exponents $\rho_q, \rho_u$ that are determined by the filter family. Locality-sensitive filtering was introduced by Becker et al. (SODA 2016) together with a framework yielding a single, balanced, tradeoff between query time and space, further relying on the assumption of an efficient oracle for the filter evaluation algorithm. We extend the LSF framework to support space-time tradeoffs and through a combination of existing techniques we remove the oracle assumption.   Building on a filter family for the unit sphere by Laarhoven (arXiv 2015) we use a kernel embedding technique by Rahimi & Recht (NIPS 2007) to show a solution to the $(r,cr)$-near neighbor problem in $\ell_s^d$-space for $0 < s \leq 2$ with query and update exponents $\rho_q=\frac{c^s(1+\lambda)^2}{(c^s+\lambda)^2}$ and $\rho_u=\frac{c^s(1-\lambda)^2}{(c^s+\lambda)^2}$ where $\lambda\in[-1,1]$ is a tradeoff parameter. This result improves upon the space-time tradeoff of Kapralov (PODS 2015) and is shown to be optimal in the case of a balanced tradeoff. Finally, we show a lower bound for the space-time tradeoff on the unit sphere that matches Laarhoven's and our own upper bound in the case of random data.",1
95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"Nearest neighbor search and k-nearest neighbor graph construction are two fundamental issues arise from many disciplines such as multimedia information retrieval, data-mining and machine learning. They become more and more imminent given the big data emerge in various fields in recent years. In this paper, a simple but effective solution both for approximate k-nearest neighbor search and approximate k-nearest neighbor graph construction is presented. These two issues are addressed jointly in our solution. On the one hand, the approximate k-nearest neighbor graph construction is treated as a search task. Each sample along with its k-nearest neighbors are joined into the k-nearest neighbor graph by performing the nearest neighbor search sequentially on the graph under construction. On the other hand, the built k-nearest neighbor graph is used to support k-nearest neighbor search. Since the graph is built online, the dynamic update on the graph, which is not possible from most of the existing solutions, is supported. This solution is feasible for various distance measures. Its effectiveness both as k-nearest neighbor construction and k-nearest neighbor search approaches is verified across different types of data in different scales, various dimensions and under different metrics.",1
95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"This technical note compares two coding (quantization) schemes for random projections in the context of sub-linear time approximate near neighbor search. The first scheme is based on uniform quantization while the second scheme utilizes a uniform quantization plus a uniformly random offset (which has been popular in practice). The prior work compared the two schemes in the context of similarity estimation and training linear classifiers, with the conclusion that the step of random offset is not necessary and may hurt the performance (depending on the similarity level). The task of near neighbor search is related to similarity estimation with importance distinctions and requires own study. In this paper, we demonstrate that in the context of near neighbor search, the step of random offset is not needed either and may hurt the performance (sometimes significantly so, depending on the similarity and other parameters).",1
95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"We take a first step towards a rigorous asymptotic analysis of graph-based approaches for finding (approximate) nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces, by analyzing the complexity of (randomized) greedy walks on the approximate near neighbor graph. For random data sets of size $n = 2^{o(d)}$ on the $d$-dimensional Euclidean unit sphere, using near neighbor graphs we can provably solve the approximate nearest neighbor problem with approximation factor $c > 1$ in query time $n^{\rho_q + o(1)}$ and space $n^{1 + \rho_s + o(1)}$, for arbitrary $\rho_q, \rho_s \geq 0$ satisfying \begin{align} (2c^2 - 1) \rho_q + 2 c^2 (c^2 - 1) \sqrt{\rho_s (1 - \rho_s)} \geq c^4. \end{align} Graph-based near neighbor searching is especially competitive with hash-based methods for small $c$ and near-linear memory, and in this regime the asymptotic scaling of a greedy graph-based search matches the recent optimal hash-based trade-offs of Andoni-Laarhoven-Razenshteyn-Waingarten [SODA'17]. We further study how the trade-offs scale when the data set is of size $n = 2^{\Theta(d)}$, and analyze asymptotic complexities when applying these results to lattice sieving.",1
95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"Fast approximate nearest neighbor (NN) search in large databases is becoming popular. Several powerful learning-based formulations have been proposed recently. However, not much attention has been paid to a more fundamental question: how difficult is (approximate) nearest neighbor search in a given data set? And which data properties affect the difficulty of nearest neighbor search and how? This paper introduces the first concrete measure called Relative Contrast that can be used to evaluate the influence of several crucial data characteristics such as dimensionality, sparsity, and database size simultaneously in arbitrary normed metric spaces. Moreover, we present a theoretical analysis to prove how the difficulty measure (relative contrast) determines/affects the complexity of Local Sensitive Hashing, a popular approximate NN search method. Relative contrast also provides an explanation for a family of heuristic hashing algorithms with good practical performance based on PCA. Finally, we show that most of the previous works in measuring NN search meaningfulness/difficulty can be derived as special asymptotic cases for dense vectors of the proposed measure.",1
95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"We investigate the problem of finding reverse nearest neighbors efficiently. Although provably good solutions exist for this problem in low or fixed dimensions, to this date the methods proposed in high dimensions are mostly heuristic. We introduce a method that is both provably correct and efficient in all dimensions, based on a reduction of the problem to one instance of $\e$-nearest neighbor search plus a controlled number of instances of {\em exhaustive $r$-\pleb}, a variant of {\em Point Location among Equal Balls} where all the $r$-balls centered at the data points that contain the query point are sought for, not just one. The former problem has been extensively studied and elegantly solved in high dimensions using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) techniques. By contrast, the latter problem has a complexity that is still not fully understood. We revisit the analysis of the LSH scheme for exhaustive $r$-\pleb using a somewhat refined notion of locality-sensitive family of hash function, which brings out a meaningful output-sensitive term in the complexity of the problem. Our analysis, combined with a non-isometric lifting of the data, enables us to answer exhaustive $r$-\pleb queries (and down the road reverse nearest neighbors queries) efficiently. Along the way, we obtain a simple algorithm for answering exact nearest neighbor queries, whose complexity is parametrized by some {\em condition number} measuring the inherent difficulty of a given instance of the problem.",1
95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"Recent technological advancements have led to the generation of huge amounts of data over the web, such as text, image, audio and video. Most of this data is high dimensional and sparse, for e.g., the bag-of-words representation used for representing text. Often, an efficient search for similar data points needs to be performed in many applications like clustering, nearest neighbour search, ranking and indexing. Even though there have been significant increases in computational power, a simple brute-force similarity-search on such datasets is inefficient and at times impossible. Thus, it is desirable to get a compressed representation which preserves the similarity between data points. In this work, we consider the data points as sets and use Jaccard similarity as the similarity measure. Compression techniques are generally evaluated on the following parameters --1) Randomness required for compression, 2) Time required for compression, 3) Dimension of the data after compression, and 4) Space required to store the compressed data. Ideally, the compressed representation of the data should be such, that the similarity between each pair of data points is preserved, while keeping the time and the randomness required for compression as low as possible.   We show that the compression technique suggested by Pratap and Kulkarni also works well for Jaccard similarity. We present a theoretical proof of the same and complement it with rigorous experimentations on synthetic as well as real-world datasets. We also compare our results with the state-of-the-art ""min-wise independent permutation"", and show that our compression algorithm achieves almost equal accuracy while significantly reducing the compression time and the randomness.",1
95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"We propose a new algorithm for fast approximate nearest neighbor search based on the properties of ordered vectors. Data vectors are classified based on the index and sign of their largest components, thereby partitioning the space in a number of cones centered in the origin. The query is itself classified, and the search starts from the selected cone and proceeds to neighboring ones. Overall, the proposed algorithm corresponds to locality sensitive hashing in the space of directions, with hashing based on the order of components. Thanks to the statistical features emerging through ordering, it deals very well with the challenging case of unstructured data, and is a valuable building block for more complex techniques dealing with structured data. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data prove the proposed algorithm to provide a state-of-the-art performance.",1
95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"We survey permutation-based methods for approximate k-nearest neighbor search. In these methods, every data point is represented by a ranked list of pivots sorted by the distance to this point. Such ranked lists are called permutations. The underpinning assumption is that, for both metric and non-metric spaces, the distance between permutations is a good proxy for the distance between original points. Thus, it should be possible to efficiently retrieve most true nearest neighbors by examining only a tiny subset of data points whose permutations are similar to the permutation of a query. We further test this assumption by carrying out an extensive experimental evaluation where permutation methods are pitted against state-of-the art benchmarks (the multi-probe LSH, the VP-tree, and proximity-graph based retrieval) on a variety of realistically large data set from the image and textual domain. The focus is on the high-accuracy retrieval methods for generic spaces. Additionally, we assume that both data and indices are stored in main memory. We find permutation methods to be reasonably efficient and describe a setup where these methods are most useful. To ease reproducibility, we make our software and data sets publicly available.",1

We separate quantization from pairwise similarity preserving as the objective function is very different though quantization, as we show, can be derived from preserving the pairwise similarities. In addition, we present the evaluation protocols, and the general performance analysis, and point out that the quantization algorithms perform superiorly in terms of search accuracy, search time cost, and space cost. Finally, we introduce a few emerging topics.",1
95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"A common approach to implementing similarity search applications is the usage of distance functions, where small distances indicate high similarity. In the case of metric distance functions, metric index structures can be used to accelerate nearest neighbor queries. On the other hand, many applications ask for approximate subsequences or subsets, e.g. searching for a similar partial sequence of a gene, for a similar scene in a movie, or for a similar object in a picture which is represented by a set of multidimensional features. Metric index structures such as the M-Tree cannot be utilized for these tasks because of the symmetry of the metric distance functions. In this work, we propose the SuperM-Tree as an extension of the M-Tree where approximate subsequence and subset queries become nearest neighbor queries. In order to do this, we introduce metric subset spaces as a generalized concept of metric spaces. Various metric distance functions can be extended to metric subset distance functions, e.g. the Euclidean distance (on windows), the Hausdorff distance (on subsets), the Edit distance and the Dog-Keeper distance (on subsequences). We show that these examples subsume the applications mentioned above.",1

95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in many areas of data mining, machine learning and computer vision. The performance of traditional hierarchical structure (tree) based methods decreases as the dimensionality of data grows, while hashing based methods usually lack efficiency in practice. Recently, the graph based methods have drawn considerable attention. The main idea is that \emph{a neighbor of a neighbor is also likely to be a neighbor}, which we refer as \emph{NN-expansion}. These methods construct a $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) graph offline. And at online search stage, these methods find candidate neighbors of a query point in some way (\eg, random selection), and then check the neighbors of these candidate neighbors for closer ones iteratively. Despite some promising results, there are mainly two problems with these approaches: 1) These approaches tend to converge to local optima. 2) Constructing a $k$NN graph is time consuming. We find that these two problems can be nicely solved when we provide a good initialization for NN-expansion. In this paper, we propose EFANNA, an extremely fast approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm based on $k$NN Graph. Efanna nicely combines the advantages of hierarchical structure based methods and nearest-neighbor-graph based methods. Extensive experiments have shown that EFANNA outperforms the state-of-art algorithms both on approximate nearest neighbor search and approximate nearest neighbor graph construction.

95,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"Introduction. Neural network models of autoassociative, distributed memory allow storage and retrieval of many items (vectors) where the number of stored items can exceed the vector dimension (the number of neurons in the network). This opens the possibility of a sublinear time search (in the number of stored items) for approximate nearest neighbors among vectors of high dimension. The purpose of this paper is to review models of autoassociative, distributed memory that can be naturally implemented by neural networks (mainly with local learning rules and iterative dynamics based on information locally available to neurons). Scope. The survey is focused mainly on the networks of Hopfield, Willshaw and Potts, that have connections between pairs of neurons and operate on sparse binary vectors. We discuss not only autoassociative memory, but also the generalization properties of these networks. We also consider neural networks with higher-order connections and networks with a bipartite graph structure for non-binary data with linear constraints. Conclusions. In conclusion we discuss the relations to similarity search, advantages and drawbacks of these techniques, and topics for further research. An interesting and still not completely resolved question is whether neural autoassociative memories can search for approximate nearest neighbors faster than other index structures for similarity search, in particular for the case of very high dimensional vectors.",1

We consider two scenarios: the unlimited vision, when the robot situated at a point p of the terrain explores (sees) all points q of the terrain for which the segment pq belongs to the terrain, and the limited vision, when we require additionally that the distance between p and q be at most 1. All points of the terrain (except obstacles) have to be explored and the performance of an exploration algorithm is measured by the length of the trajectory of the robot. For unlimited vision we show an exploration algorithm with complexity O(P + D?k), where P is the total perimeter of the terrain (including perimeters of obstacles), D is the diameter of the convex hull of the terrain, and k is the number of obstacles. We do not assume knowledge of these parameters. We also prove a matching lower bound showing that the above complexity is optimal, even if the terrain is known to the robot. For limited vision we show exploration algorithms with complexity O(P + A + ?Ak), where A is the area of the terrain (excluding obstacles). Our algorithms work either for arbitrary terrains, if one of the parameters A or k is known, or for c-fat terrains, where c is any constant (unknown to the robot) and no additional knowledge is assumed. (A terrain T with obstacles is c-fat if R/r ? c, where R is the radius of the smallest disc containing T and r is the radius of the largest disc contained in T .) We also prove a matching lower bound ?(P + A + ?Ak) on the complexity of exploration for limited vision, even if the terrain is known to the robot.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Hill and Kertz studied the prophet inequality on iid distributions [The Annals of Probability 1982]. They proved a theoretical bound of $1-\frac{1}{e}$ on the approximation factor of their algorithm. They conjectured that the best approximation factor for arbitrarily large n is $\frac{1}{1+1/e} \approx 0.731$. This conjecture remained open prior to this paper for over 30 years. In this paper we present a threshold-based algorithm for the prophet inequality with n iid distributions. Using a nontrivial and novel approach we show that our algorithm is a 0.738-approximation algorithm. By beating the bound of $\frac{1}{1+1/e}$, this refutes the conjecture of Hill and Kertz. Moreover, we generalize our results to non-iid distributions and discuss its applications in mechanism design.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"The idea of opposition-based learning was introduced 10 years ago. Since then a noteworthy group of researchers has used some notions of oppositeness to improve existing optimization and learning algorithms. Among others, evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement agents, and neural networks have been reportedly extended into their opposition-based version to become faster and/or more accurate. However, most works still use a simple notion of opposites, namely linear (or type- I) opposition, that for each $x\in[a,b]$ assigns its opposite as $\breve{x}_I=a+b-x$. This, of course, is a very naive estimate of the actual or true (non-linear) opposite $\breve{x}_{II}$, which has been called type-II opposite in literature. In absence of any knowledge about a function $y=f(\mathbf{x})$ that we need to approximate, there seems to be no alternative to the naivety of type-I opposition if one intents to utilize oppositional concepts. But the question is if we can receive some level of accuracy increase and time savings by using the naive opposite estimate $\breve{x}_I$ according to all reports in literature, what would we be able to gain, in terms of even higher accuracies and more reduction in computational complexity, if we would generate and employ true opposites? This work introduces an approach to approximate type-II opposites using evolving fuzzy rules when we first perform opposition mining. We show with multiple examples that learning true opposites is possible when we mine the opposites from the training data to subsequently approximate $\breve{x}_{II}=f(\mathbf{x},y)$.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are distributed (unevenly) over an extremely large number of \nodes, but the goal remains to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of utmost importance.   A motivating example for federated optimization arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices rather than logging it to a data center for training. Instead, the mobile devices are used as nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have an extremely large number of devices in our network, each of which has only a tiny fraction of data available totally; in particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, we assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution.   We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of federated optimization.",0

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Recent approaches on visual scene understanding attempt to build a scene graph -- a computational representation of objects and their pairwise relationships. Such rich semantic representation is very appealing, yet difficult to obtain from a single image, especially when considering complex spatial arrangements in the scene. Differently, an image sequence conveys useful information using the multi-view geometric relations arising from camera motion. Indeed, in such cases, object relationships are naturally related to the 3D scene structure. To this end, this paper proposes a system that first computes the geometrical location of objects in a generic scene and then efficiently constructs scene graphs from video by embedding such geometrical reasoning. Such compelling representation is obtained using a new model where geometric and visual features are merged using an RNN framework. We report results on a dataset we created for the task of 3D scene graph generation in multiple views.",0

For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning.   We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting.

We develop a general distributed algorithmic framework for the (nonconvex) DL problem and establish its asymptotic convergence. The new method hinges on Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) techniques coupled with i) a gradient tracking mechanism instrumental to locally estimate the missing global information; and ii) a consensus step, as a mechanism to distribute the computations among the agents.

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated learning enables thousands of participants to construct a deep learning model without sharing their private training data with each other. For example, multiple smartphones can jointly train a next-word predictor for keyboards without revealing what individual users type. We demonstrate that any participant in federated learning can introduce hidden backdoor functionality into the joint global model, e.g., to ensure that an image classifier assigns an attacker-chosen label to images with certain features, or that a word predictor completes certain sentences with an attacker-chosen word.   We design and evaluate a new model-poisoning methodology based on model replacement. An attacker selected in a single round of federated learning can cause the global model to immediately reach 100% accuracy on the backdoor task. We evaluate the attack under different assumptions for the standard federated-learning tasks and show that it greatly outperforms data poisoning. Our generic constrain-and-scale technique also evades anomaly detection-based defenses by incorporating the evasion into the attacker's loss function during training.",0

Using techniques from matrix perturbation theory, we reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in dimensionality selection for word embeddings. This bias-variance trade-off sheds light on many empirical observations which were previously unexplained, for example the existence of an optimal dimensionality. Moreover, new insights and discoveries, like when and how word embeddings are robust to over-fitting, are revealed.

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Recommender systems research has experienced different stages such as from user preference understanding to content analysis. Typical recommendation algorithms were built on the following bases: (1) assuming users and items are IID, namely independent and identically distributed, and (2) focusing on specific aspects such as user preferences or contents. In reality, complex recommendation tasks involve and request (1) personalized outcomes to tailor heterogeneous subjective preferences; and (2) explicit and implicit objective coupling relationships between users, items, and ratings to be considered as intrinsic forces driving preferences. This inevitably involves the non-IID complexity and the need of combining subjective preference with objective couplings hidden in recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a novel generic coupled matrix factorization (CMF) model by incorporating non-IID coupling relations between users and items. Such couplings integrate the intra-coupled interactions within an attribute and inter-coupled interactions among different attributes. Experimental results on two open data sets demonstrate that the user/item couplings can be effectively applied in RS and CMF outperforms the benchmark methods.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"The majority of online reviews consist of plain-text feedback together with a single numeric score. However, there are multiple dimensions to products and opinions, and understanding the `aspects' that contribute to users' ratings may help us to better understand their individual preferences. For example, a user's impression of an audiobook presumably depends on aspects such as the story and the narrator, and knowing their opinions on these aspects may help us to recommend better products. In this paper, we build models for rating systems in which such dimensions are explicit, in the sense that users leave separate ratings for each aspect of a product. By introducing new corpora consisting of five million reviews, rated with between three and six aspects, we evaluate our models on three prediction tasks: First, we use our model to uncover which parts of a review discuss which of the rated aspects. Second, we use our model to summarize reviews, which for us means finding the sentences that best explain a user's rating. Finally, since aspect ratings are optional in many of the datasets we consider, we use our model to recover those ratings that are missing from a user's evaluation. Our model matches state-of-the-art approaches on existing small-scale datasets, while scaling to the real-world datasets we introduce. Moreover, our model is able to `disentangle' content and sentiment words: we automatically learn content words that are indicative of a particular aspect as well as the aspect-specific sentiment words that are indicative of a particular rating.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated learning distributes model training among a multitude of agents, who, guided by privacy concerns, perform training using their local data but share only model parameter updates, for iterative aggregation at the server. In this work, we explore the threat of model poisoning attacks on federated learning initiated by a single, non-colluding malicious agent where the adversarial objective is to cause the model to misclassify a set of chosen inputs with high confidence. We explore a number of strategies to carry out this attack, starting with simple boosting of the malicious agent's update to overcome the effects of other agents' updates. To increase attack stealth, we propose an alternating minimization strategy, which alternately optimizes for the training loss and the adversarial objective. We follow up by using parameter estimation for the benign agents' updates to improve on attack success. Finally, we use a suite of interpretability techniques to generate visual explanations of model decisions for both benign and malicious models and show that the explanations are nearly visually indistinguishable. Our results indicate that even a highly constrained adversary can carry out model poisoning attacks while simultaneously maintaining stealth, thus highlighting the vulnerability of the federated learning setting and the need to develop effective defense strategies.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"In supervised machine learning, an agent is typically trained once and then deployed. While this works well for static settings, robots often operate in changing environments and must quickly learn new things from data streams. In this paradigm, known as streaming learning, a learner is trained online, in a single pass, from a data stream that cannot be assumed to be independent and identically distributed (iid). Streaming learning will cause conventional deep neural networks (DNNs) to fail for two reasons: 1) they need multiple passes through the entire dataset; and 2) non-iid data will cause catastrophic forgetting. An old fix to both of these issues is rehearsal. To learn a new example, rehearsal mixes it with previous examples, and then this mixture is used to update the DNN. Full rehearsal is slow and memory intensive because it stores all previously observed examples, and its effectiveness for preventing catastrophic forgetting has not been studied in modern DNNs. Here, we describe the ExStream algorithm for memory efficient rehearsal and compare it to alternatives. We find that full rehearsal can eliminate catastrophic forgetting in a variety of streaming learning settings, with ExStream performing well using far less memory and computation.",0

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Communication on heterogeneous edge networks is a fundamental bottleneck in Federated Learning (FL), restricting both model capacity and user participation. To address this issue, we introduce two novel strategies to reduce communication costs: (1) the use of lossy compression on the global model sent server-to-client; and (2) Federated Dropout, which allows users to efficiently train locally on smaller subsets of the global model and also provides a reduction in both client-to-server communication and local computation. We empirically show that these strategies, combined with existing compression approaches for client-to-server communication, collectively provide up to a $14\times$ reduction in server-to-client communication, a $1.7\times$ reduction in local computation, and a $28\times$ reduction in upload communication, all without degrading the quality of the final model. We thus comprehensively reduce FL's impact on client device resources, allowing higher capacity models to be trained, and a more diverse set of users to be reached.",0

Given a sequence (e.g. a natural language sentence), the transfer learning, usually enabled by recurrent neural network (RNN), represents the sequential information transfer. RNN uses a chain of repeating cells to model the sequence data. However, previous studies of neural network based transfer learning simply represents the whole sentence by a single vector, which is unfeasible for seq2seq and sequence labeling. Meanwhile, such layer-wise transfer learning mechanisms lose the fine-grained cell-level information from the source domain.   In this paper, we proposed the aligned recurrent transfer, ART, to achieve cell-level information transfer. ART is under the pre-training framework. Each cell attentively accepts transferred information from a set of positions in the source domain. Therefore, ART learns the cross-domain word collocations in a more flexible way.

Each agent faces some (potentially unique) set of tasks; the key idea is that knowledge learned from these tasks may benefit other agents trying to learn different (but related) tasks. Our Collective Lifelong Learning Algorithm (CoLLA) provides an efficient way for a network of agents to share their learned knowledge in a distributed and decentralized manner, while preserving the privacy of the locally observed data. Note that a decentralized scheme is a subclass of distributed algorithms where a central server does not exist and in addition to data, computations are also distributed among the agents.

In this paper, we aim to optimize the structure of the neural network models in federated learning using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to simultaneously minimize the communication costs and the global model test errors. A scalable method for encoding network connectivity is adapted to federated learning to enhance the efficiency in evolving deep neural networks.

The ""traditional"" approach of using supervised learning relies on a domain expert, and has two main limitations: requiring skilled humans to supply correct labels limits its scalability and accuracy, and relying on existing clinical descriptions limits the sorts of patterns that can be found. For instance, it may fail to acknowledge that a disease treated as a single condition may really have several subtypes with different phenotypes, as seems to be the case with asthma and heart disease.

Financial reports are produced to assess healthcare organizations on some key performance indicators to steer their healthcare delivery. Similarly, at a clinical level, data on patient status is conveyed by means of textual descriptions to facilitate patient review, shift handover and care transitions. Likewise, patients are informed about data on their health status and treatments via text, in the form of reports or via ehealth platforms by their doctors.

The Fisher vector (FV) representation extends BoW, by considering the first and second order statistics of local descriptors. In both representations local descriptors are assumed to be identically and independently distributed (iid), which is a poor assumption from a modeling perspective. It has been experimentally observed that the performance of BoW and FV representations can be improved by employing discounting transformations such as power normalization. In this paper, we introduce non-iid models by treating the model parameters as latent variables which are integrated out, rendering all local regions dependent. Using the Fisher kernel principle we encode an image by the gradient of the data log-likelihood w.r.t. the model hyper-parameters. Our models naturally generate discounting effects in the representations; suggesting that such transformations have proven successful because they closely correspond to the representations obtained for non-iid models. To enable tractable computation, we rely on variational free-energy bounds to learn the hyper-parameters and to compute approximate Fisher kernels. Our experimental evaluation results validate that our models lead to performance improvements comparable to using power normalization, as employed in state-of-the-art feature aggregation methods.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Intrinsic Image Decomposition (IID) is a challenging and interesting computer vision problem with various applications in several fields. We present novel semantic priors and an integrated approach for single image IID that involves analyzing image at three hierarchical context levels. Local context priors capture scene properties at each pixel within a small neighbourhood. Mid-level context priors encode object level semantics. Global context priors establish correspondences at the scene level. Our semantic priors are designed on both fixed and flexible regions, using selective search method and Convolutional Neural Network features. Our IID method is an iterative multistage optimization scheme and consists of two complementary formulations: $L_2$ smoothing for shading and $L_1$ sparsity for reflectance. Experiments and analysis of our method indicate the utility of our semantic priors and structured hierarchical analysis in an IID framework. We compare our method with other contemporary IID solutions and show results with lesser artifacts. Finally, we highlight that proper choice and encoding of prior knowledge can produce competitive results even when compared to end-to-end deep learning IID methods, signifying the importance of such priors. We believe that the insights and techniques presented in this paper would be useful in the future IID research.",0

The idea for the adaptiveness comes from the technique of extrapolation: to get an estimate for the error against the gradient flow which underlies SGD, we compare the result obtained by one full step and two half-steps. The algorithm is applied in two separate frameworks: federated and differentially private learning. Using examples of deep neural networks we empirically show that the adaptive algorithm is competitive with manually tuned commonly used optimisation methods for differentially privately training. We also show that it works robustly in the case of federated learning unlike commonly used optimisation methods.",0

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"We present a new efficient method for approximate search in electronic lexica. Given an input string (the pattern) and a similarity threshold, the algorithm retrieves all entries of the lexicon that are sufficiently similar to the pattern. Search is organized in subsearches that always start with an exact partial match where a substring of the input pattern is aligned with a substring of a lexicon word. Afterwards this partial match is extended stepwise to larger substrings. For aligning further parts of the pattern with corresponding parts of lexicon entries, more errors are tolerated at each subsequent step. For supporting this alignment order, which may start at any part of the pattern, the lexicon is represented as a structure that enables immediate access to any substring of a lexicon word and permits the extension of such substrings in both directions. Experimental evaluations of the approximate search procedure are given that show significant efficiency improvements compared to existing techniques. Since the technique can be used for large error bounds it offers interesting possibilities for approximate search in special collections of ""long"" strings, such as phrases, sentences, or book ti",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"We tackle the problem of penalty selection of regularization on the basis of the minimum description length (MDL) principle. In particular, we consider that the design space of the penalty function is high-dimensional. In this situation, the luckiness-normalized-maximum-likelihood(LNML)-minimization approach is favorable, because LNML quantifies the goodness of regularized models with any forms of penalty functions in view of the minimum description length principle, and guides us to a good penalty function through the high-dimensional space. However, the minimization of LNML entails two major challenges: 1) the computation of the normalizing factor of LNML and 2) its minimization in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present a novel regularization selection method (MDL-RS), in which a tight upper bound of LNML (uLNML) is minimized with local convergence guarantee. Our main contribution is the derivation of uLNML, which is a uniform-gap upper bound of LNML in an analytic expression. This solves the above challenges in an approximate manner because it allows us to accurately approximate LNML and then efficiently minimize it. The experimental results show that MDL-RS improves the generalization performance of regularized estimates specifically when the model has redundant parameters.",0

With domain adversarial training, deep networks can learn disentangled and transferable features that effectively diminish the dataset shift between the source and target domains for knowledge transfer. In the era of Big Data, the ready availability of large-scale labeled datasets has stimulated wide interest in partial domain adaptation (PDA), which transfers a recognizer from a labeled large domain to an unlabeled small domain. It extends standard domain adaptation to the scenario where target labels are only a subset of source labels. Under the condition that target labels are unknown, the key challenge of PDA is how to transfer relevant examples in the shared classes to promote positive transfer, and ignore irrelevant ones in the specific classes to mitigate negative transfer. In this work, we propose a unified approach to PDA, Example Transfer Network (ETN), which jointly learns domain-invariant representations across the source and target domains, and a progressive weighting scheme that quantifies the transferability of source examples while controlling their importance to the learning task in the target domain. A thorough evaluation on several benchmark datasets shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for partial domain adaptation tasks.",0

The use of crowdsourcing image and videos on crisis management systems can aid in these situations by providing more information than verbal/textual descriptions. Due to the usual high volume of data, automatic solutions need to discard non-relevant content without losing relevant information. There are several methods for fire detection on video using color-based models. However, they are not adequate for still image processing, because they can suffer on high false-positive results. These methods also suffer from parameters with little physical meaning, which makes fine tuning a difficult task. In this context, we propose a novel fire detection method for still images that uses classification based on color features combined with texture classification on superpixel regions. Our method uses a reduced number of parameters if compared to previous works, easing the process of fine tuning the method.

The work of the paper makes two contributions: a). The modified network can converge fast and keep the same functionality so that we do not need to train from scratch again; b). The layer size of the added layer in the neural network is controlled by removing the redundant parameters with sparse optimization.

We consider three extensions of this fundamental problem that are motivated by practical considerations in real-world, time-critical identification tasks such as emergency response. First, we consider the problem where the objects are partitioned into groups, and the goal is to identify only the group to which the object belongs. Second, we address the situation where the queries are partitioned into groups, and an algorithm may suggest a group of queries to a human user, who then selects the actual query. Third, we consider the problem of query learning in the presence of persistent query noise, and relate it to group identification. To address these problems we show that a standard algorithm for query learning, known as the splitting algorithm or generalized binary search, may be viewed as a generalization of Shannon-Fano coding. We then extend this result to the group-based settings, leading to new algorithms. The performance of our algorithms is demonstrated on simulated data and on a database used by first responders for toxic chemical identification.",0

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence (AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential functions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare policies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial intelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data) by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an online agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real patient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service models of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a 30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further enhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly half the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain environments.

One area in deep neural networks that is ripe for exploration is neural connectivity formation. A pivotal study on the brain tissue of rats found that synaptic formation for specific functional connectivity in neocortical neural microcircuits can be surprisingly well modeled and predicted as a random formation. Motivated by this intriguing finding, we introduce the concept of StochasticNet, where deep neural networks are formed via stochastic connectivity between neurons. As a result, any type of deep neural networks can be formed as a StochasticNet by allowing the neuron connectivity to be stochastic. Stochastic synaptic formations, in a deep neural network architecture, can allow for efficient utilization of neurons for performing specific tasks. To evaluate the feasibility of such a deep neural network architecture, we train a StochasticNet using four different image datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, SVHN, and STL-10). Experimental results show that a StochasticNet, using less than half the number of neural connections as a conventional deep neural network, achieves comparable accuracy and reduces overfitting on the CIFAR-10, MNIST and SVHN dataset. Interestingly, StochasticNet with less than half the number of neural connections, achieved a higher accuracy (relative improvement in test error rate of ~6% compared to ConvNet) on the STL-10 dataset than a conventional deep neural network.

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Contrary to standard statistical models, unnormalised statistical models only specify the likelihood function up to a constant. While such models are natural and popular, the lack of normalisation makes inference much more difficult. Here we show that inferring the parameters of a unnormalised model on a space $\Omega$ can be mapped onto an equivalent problem of estimating the intensity of a Poisson point process on $\Omega$. The unnormalised statistical model now specifies an intensity function that does not need to be normalised. Effectively, the normalisation constant may now be inferred as just another parameter, at no loss of information. The result can be extended to cover non-IID models, which includes for example unnormalised models for sequences of graphs (dynamical graphs), or for sequences of binary vectors. As a consequence, we prove that unnormalised parameteric inference in non-IID models can be turned into a semi-parametric estimation problem. Moreover, we show that the noise-contrastive divergence of Gutmann & Hyv\""arinen (2012) can be understood as an approximation of the Poisson transform, and extended to non-IID settings.

The GDPR is designed to give users more control over their personal data, which motivates us to explore machine learning frameworks for data sharing that do not violate user privacy. To meet this goal, in this paper, we propose a novel lossless privacy-preserving tree-boosting system known as SecureBoost in the setting of federated learning. SecureBoost first conducts entity alignment under a privacy-preserving protocol and then constructs boosting trees across multiple parties with a carefully designed encryption strategy. This federated learning system allows the learning process to be jointly conducted over multiple parties with common user samples but different feature sets, which corresponds to a vertically partitioned data set. An advantage of SecureBoost is that it provides the same level of accuracy as the non-privacy-preserving approach while at the same time, reveals no information of each private data provider. We show that the SecureBoost framework is as accurate as other non-federated gradient tree-boosting algorithms that require centralized data and thus it is highly scalable and practical for industrial applications such as credit risk analysis. To this end, we discuss information leakage during the protocol execution and propose ways to provably reduce it.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"The stringent requirements for low-latency and privacy of the emerging high-stake applications with intelligent devices such as drones and smart vehicles make the cloud computing inapplicable in these scenarios. Instead, edge machine learning becomes increasingly attractive for performing training and inference directly at network edges without sending data to a centralized data center. This stimulates a nascent field termed as federated learning for training a machine learning model on computation, storage, energy and bandwidth limited mobile devices in a distributed manner. To preserve data privacy and address the issues of unbalanced and non-IID data points across different devices, the federated averaging algorithm has been proposed for global model aggregation by computing the weighted average of locally updated model at each selected device. However, the limited communication bandwidth becomes the main bottleneck for aggregating the locally computed updates. We thus propose a novel over-the-air computation based approach for fast global model aggregation via exploring the superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel. This is achieved by joint device selection and beamforming design, which is modeled as a sparse and low-rank optimization problem to support efficient algorithms design. To achieve this goal, we provide a difference-of-convex-functions (DC) representation for the sparse and low-rank function to enhance sparsity and accurately detect the fixed-rank constraint in the procedure of device selection.

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Pac-Bayes bounds are among the most accurate generalization bounds for classifiers learned from independently and identically distributed (IID) data, and it is particularly so for margin classifiers: there have been recent contributions showing how practical these bounds can be either to perform model selection (Ambroladze et al., 2007) or even to directly guide the learning of linear classifiers (Germain et al., 2009). However, there are many practical situations where the training data show some dependencies and where the traditional IID assumption does not hold. Stating generalization bounds for such frameworks is therefore of the utmost interest, both from theoretical and practical standpoints. In this work, we propose the first - to the best of our knowledge - Pac-Bayes generalization bounds for classifiers trained on data exhibiting interdependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our results is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency graph that encodes the dependencies within the data, in sets of independent data, thanks to graph fractional covers. Our bounds are very general, since being able to find an upper bound on the fractional chromatic number of the dependency graph is sufficient to get new Pac-Bayes bounds for specific settings. We show how our results can be used to derive bounds for ranking statistics (such as Auc) and classifiers trained on data distributed according to a stationary {\ss}-mixing process. In the way, we show how our approach seemlessly allows us to deal with U-processes.

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Distributed asynchronous offline training has received widespread attention in recent years because of its high performance on large-scale data and complex models. As data are distributed from cloud-centric to edge nodes, a big challenge for distributed machine learning systems is how to handle native and natural non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data for training. Previous asynchronous training methods do not have a satisfying performance on non-IID data because it would result in that the training process fluctuates greatly which leads to an abnormal convergence. We propose a gradient scheduling algorithm with partly averaged gradients and global momentum (GSGM) for non-IID data distributed asynchronous training. Our key idea is to apply global momentum and local average to the biased gradient after scheduling, in order to make the training process steady. Experimental results show that for non-IID data training under the same experimental conditions, GSGM on popular optimization algorithms can achieve a 20% increase in training stability with a slight improvement in accuracy on Fashion-Mnist and CIFAR-10 datasets. Meanwhile, when expanding distributed scale on CIFAR-100 dataset that results in sparse data distribution, GSGM can perform a 37% improvement on training stability. Moreover, only GSGM can converge well when the number of computing nodes grows to 30, compared to the state-of-the-art distributed asynchronous algorithms. At the same time, GSGM is robust to different degrees of non-IID data.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated Learning is a distributed learning paradigm with two key challenges that differentiate it from traditional distributed optimization: (1) significant variability in terms of the systems characteristics on each device in the network (systems heterogeneity), and (2) non-identically distributed data across the network (statistical heterogeneity). In this work, we introduce a framework, FedProx, to tackle heterogeneity in federated networks. FedProx can be viewed as a generalization and re-parametrization of FedAvg, the current state-of-the-art method for federated learning. While this re-parameterization makes only minor modifications to the method itself, these modifications have important ramifications both in theory and in practice. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for our framework when learning over data from non-identical distributions (statistical heterogeneity), and while adhering to device-level systems constraints by allowing each participating device to perform a variable amount of work (systems heterogeneity). Practically, we demonstrate that FedProx allows for more robust convergence than FedAvg across a suite of realistic federated datasets. In particular, in highly heterogeneous settings, FedProx demonstrates significantly more stable and accurate convergence behavior relative to FedAvg---improving absolute test accuracy by 22% on average.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated Learning (FL) systems are gaining popularity as a solution to training Machine Learning (ML) models from large-scale user data collected on personal devices (e.g., smartphones) without their raw data leaving the device. At the core of FL is a network of anonymous user devices sharing training information (model parameter updates) computed locally on personal data. However, the type and degree to which user-specific information is encoded in the model updates is poorly understood. In this paper, we identify model updates encode subtle variations in which users capture and generate data. The variations provide a strong statistical signal, allowing an adversary to effectively deanonymize participating devices using a limited set of auxiliary data. We analyze resulting deanonymization attacks on diverse tasks on real-world (anonymized) user-generated data across a range of closed- and open-world scenarios. We study various strategies to mitigate the risks of deanonymization. As random perturbation methods do not offer convincing operating points, we propose data-augmentation strategies which introduces adversarial biases in device data and thereby, offer substantial protection against deanonymization threats with little effect on utility.",0

In the work, We propose a knowledge fusion algorithm for upgrading a shared model deployed on the cloud. Then, effective transfer learning methods in LFRL are introduced. LFRL is consistent with human cognitive science and fits well in cloud robotic systems. Experiments show that LFRL greatly improves the efficiency of reinforcement learning for robot navigation. The cloud robotic system deployment also shows that LFRL is capable of fusing prior knowledge. In addition, we release a cloud robotic navigation-learning website based on LFRL.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Deep neural networks are susceptible to various inference attacks as they remember information about their training data. We design white-box inference attacks to perform a comprehensive privacy analysis of deep learning models. We measure the privacy leakage through parameters of fully trained models as well as the parameter updates of models during training. We design inference algorithms for both centralized and federated learning, with respect to passive and active inference attackers, and assuming different adversary prior knowledge.   We evaluate our novel white-box membership inference attacks against deep learning algorithms to trace their training data records. We show that a straightforward extension of the known black-box attacks to the white-box setting (through analyzing the outputs of activation functions) is ineffective. We therefore design new algorithms tailored to the white-box setting by exploiting the privacy vulnerabilities of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is the algorithm used to train deep neural networks. We investigate the reasons why deep learning models may leak information about their training data. We then show that even well-generalized models are significantly susceptible to white-box membership inference attacks, by analyzing state-of-the-art pre-trained and publicly available models for the CIFAR dataset. We also show how adversarial participants, in the federated learning setting, can successfully run active membership inference attacks against other participants, even when the global model achieves high prediction accuracies.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated learning facilitates the collaborative training of models without the sharing of raw data. However, recent attacks demonstrate that simply maintaining data locality during training processes does not provide sufficient privacy guarantees. Rather, we need a federated learning system capable of preventing inference over both the messages exchanged during training and the final trained model while ensuring the resulting model also has acceptable predictive accuracy. Existing federated learning approaches either use secure multiparty computation (SMC) which is vulnerable to inference or differential privacy which can lead to low accuracy given a large number of parties with relatively small amounts of data each. In this paper, we present an alternative approach that utilizes both differential privacy and SMC to balance these trade-offs. Combining differential privacy with secure multiparty computation enables us to reduce the growth of noise injection as the number of parties increases without sacrificing privacy while maintaining a pre-defined rate of trust. Our system is therefore a scalable approach that protects against inference threats and produces models with high accuracy. Additionally, our system can be used to train a variety of machine learning models, which we validate with experimental results on 3 different machine learning algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach out-performs state of the art solutions.",0

In pursuit of such models, we propose a causal regularizer to steer predictive models towards causally-interpretable solutions and theoretically study its properties. In a large-scale analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR), our causally-regularized model outperforms its L1-regularized counterpart in causal accuracy and is competitive in predictive performance. We perform non-linear causality analysis by causally regularizing a special neural network architecture. We also show that the proposed causal regularizer can be used together with neural representation learning algorithms to yield up to 20% improvement over multilayer perceptron in detecting multivariate causation, a situation common in healthcare, where many causal factors should occur simultaneously to have an effect on the target variable.",0
0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"We propose a vision-based highway border detection algorithm using structured Hough voting. Our approach takes advantage of the geometric relationship between highway road borders and highway lane markings. It uses a strategy where a number of trained road border and lane marking detectors are triggered, followed by Hough voting to generate corresponding detection of the border and lane marking. Since the initially triggered detectors usually result in large number of positives, conventional frame-wise Hough voting is not able to always generate robust border and lane marking results. Therefore, we formulate this problem as a joint detection-and-tracking problem under the structured Hough voting model, where tracking refers to exploiting inter-frame structural information to stabilize the detection results. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superiority of the proposed structured Hough voting model over a number of baseline methods.",0

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Machine learning relies on the availability of a vast amount of data for training. However, in reality, most data are scattered across different organizations and cannot be easily integrated under many legal and practical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a new technique and framework, known as federated transfer learning (FTL), to improve statistical models under a data federation. The federation allows knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy, and enables complimentary knowledge to be transferred in the network. As a result, a target-domain party can build more flexible and powerful models by leveraging rich labels from a source-domain party. A secure transfer cross validation approach is also proposed to guard the FTL performance under the federation. The framework requires minimal modifications to the existing model structure and provides the same level of accuracy as the non-privacy-preserving approach. This framework is very flexible and can be effectively adapted to various secure multi-party machine learning tasks.",0

We show that this combined model yields superior performance on five datasets of diverse kinds of healthcare text (clinical, social, scientific, commercial).

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are unevenly distributed over an extremely large number of nodes. The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal.   A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution.   We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results for sparse convex problems. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of \federated optimization.",0

It has shown high added value in many application domains like e.g., communities analysis or network planning. In this paper, we suggest a generic methodology for summarizing information contained in CDRs data. The method is based on a parameter-free estimation of the joint distribution of the variables that describe the calls. We also suggest several well-founded criteria that allows one to browse the summary at various granularities and to explore the summary by means of insightful visualizations.

Combined with developments in data science, these massive data provide the potential to better understand the genetic underpinnings of brain diseases.

Here we propose a federated learning framework for securely accessing and meta-analyzing any biomedical data without sharing individual information. We illustrate our framework by investigating brain structural relationships across diseases and clinical cohorts.

0,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"We envision a mobile edge computing (MEC) framework for machine learning (ML) technologies, which leverages distributed client data and computation resources for training high-performance ML models while preserving client privacy. Toward this future goal, this work aims to extend Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized learning framework that enables privacy-preserving training of models, to work with heterogeneous clients in a practical cellular network. The FL protocol iteratively asks random clients to download a trainable model from a server, update it with own data, and upload the updated model to the server, while asking the server to aggregate multiple client updates to further improve the model. While clients in this protocol are free from disclosing own private data, the overall training process can become inefficient when some clients are with limited computational resources (i.e. requiring longer update time) or under poor wireless channel conditions (longer upload time). Our new FL protocol, which we refer to as FedCS, mitigates this problem and performs FL efficiently while actively managing clients based on their resource conditions. Specifically, FedCS solves a client selection problem with resource constraints, which allows the server to aggregate as many client updates as possible and to accelerate performance improvement in ML models. We conducted an experimental evaluation using publicly-available large-scale image datasets to train deep neural networks on MEC environment simulations. The experimental results show that FedCS is able to complete its training process in a significantly shorter time compared to the original FL protocol.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"In the recent years more and more high-dimensional data sets, where the number of parameters $p$ is high compared to the number of observations $n$ or even larger, are available for applied researchers. Boosting algorithms represent one of the major advances in machine learning and statistics in recent years and are suitable for the analysis of such data sets. While Lasso has been applied very successfully for high-dimensional data sets in Economics, boosting has been underutilized in this field, although it has been proven very powerful in fields like Biostatistics and Pattern Recognition. We attribute this to missing theoretical results for boosting. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap and show that boosting is a competitive method for inference of a treatment effect or instrumental variable (IV) estimation in a high-dimensional setting. First, we present the $L_2$Boosting with componentwise least squares algorithm and variants which are tailored for regression problems which are the workhorse for most Econometric problems. Then we show how $L_2$Boosting can be used for estimation of treatment effects and IV estimation. We highlight the methods and illustrate them with simulations and empirical examples.

5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We study the problem of learning to rank from pairwise preferences, and solve a long-standing open problem that has led to development of many heuristics but no provable results for our particular problem. Given a set $V$ of $n$ elements, we wish to linearly order them given pairwise preference labels. A pairwise preference label is obtained as a response, typically from a human, to the question ""which if preferred, u or v?$ for two elements $u,v\in V$. We assume possible non-transitivity paradoxes which may arise naturally due to human mistakes or irrationality. The goal is to linearly order the elements from the most preferred to the least preferred, while disagreeing with as few pairwise preference labels as possible. Our performance is measured by two parameters: The loss and the query complexity (number of pairwise preference labels we obtain). This is a typical learning problem, with the exception that the space from which the pairwise preferences is drawn is finite, consisting of ${n\choose 2}$ possibilities only. We present an active learning algorithm for this problem, with query bounds significantly beating general (non active) bounds for the same error guarantee, while almost achieving the information theoretical lower bound. Our main construct is a decomposition of the input s.t. (i) each block incurs high loss at optimum, and (ii) the optimal solution respecting the decomposition is not much worse than the true opt. The decomposition is done by adapting a recent result by Kenyon and Schudy for a related combinatorial optimization problem to the query efficient setting. We thus settle an open problem posed by learning-to-rank theoreticians and practitioners: What is a provably correct way to sample preference labels? To further show the power and practicality of our solution, we show how to use it in concert with an SVM relaxation.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Given a multivariate data set, sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) aims to extract several linear combinations of the variables that together explain the variance in the data as much as possible, while controlling the number of nonzero loadings in these combinations. In this paper we consider 8 different optimization formulations for computing a single sparse loading vector; these are obtained by combining the following factors: we employ two norms for measuring variance (L2, L1) and two sparsity-inducing norms (L0, L1), which are used in two different ways (constraint, penalty). Three of our formulations, notably the one with L0 constraint and L1 variance, have not been considered in the literature. We give a unifying reformulation which we propose to solve via a natural alternating maximization (AM) method. We show the the AM method is nontrivially equivalent to GPower (Journ\'{e}e et al; JMLR 11:517--553, 2010) for all our formulations. Besides this, we provide 24 efficient parallel SPCA implementations: 3 codes (multi-core, GPU and cluster) for each of the 8 problems. Parallelism in the methods is aimed at i) speeding up computations (our GPU code can be 100 times faster than an efficient serial code written in C++), ii) obtaining solutions explaining more variance and iii) dealing with big data problems (our cluster code is able to solve a 357 GB problem in about a minute).",0

In this context, algorithms based on factors recognition are among the best solutions. In this paper, we present a simple and very efficient algorithm for string matching based on a weak factor recognition and hashing. Our algorithm has a quadratic worst-case running time. However, despite its quadratic complexity, experimental results show that our algorithm obtains in most cases the best running times when compared, under various conditions, against the most effective algorithms present in literature.

5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Neural network pruning is an important step in design process of efficient neural networks for edge devices with limited computational power. Pruning is a form of knowledge transfer from the weights of the original network to a smaller target subnetwork. We propose a new method for compute-constrained structured channel-wise pruning of convolutional neural networks. The method iteratively fine-tunes the network, while gradually tapering the computation resources available to the pruned network via a holonomic constraint in the method of Lagrangian multipliers framework. An explicit and adaptive automatic control over the rate of tapering is provided. The trainable parameters of our pruning method are separate from the weights of the neural network, which allows us to avoid the interference with the neural network solver (e.g. avoid the direct dependence of pruning speed on neural network learning rates). Our method combines the `rigoristic' approach by the direct application of constrained optimization, avoiding the pitfalls of ADMM-based methods, like their need to define the target amount of resources for each pruning run, and direct dependence of pruning speed and priority of pruning on the relative scale of weights between layers. For VGG-16 @ ILSVRC-2012, we achieve reduction of 15.47 -> 3.87 GMAC with only 1% top-1 accuracy reduction (68.4% -> 67.4%).

In this work, we proposed RawNet, a complete end-to-end neural vocoder following the auto-encoder structure for speaker-dependent and -independent speech synthesis. It automatically learns to extract features and recover audio using neural networks, which include a coder network to capture a higher representation of the input audio and an autoregressive voder network to restore the audio in a sample-by-sample manner.

5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"This paper proposes algorithms for learning two-level Boolean rules in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF, i.e. AND-of-ORs) or Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF, i.e. OR-of-ANDs) as a type of human-interpretable classification model, aiming for a favorable trade-off between the classification accuracy and the simplicity of the rule. Two formulations are proposed. The first is an integer program whose objective function is a combination of the total number of errors and the total number of features used in the rule. We generalize a previously proposed linear programming (LP) relaxation from one-level to two-level rules. The second formulation replaces the 0-1 classification error with the Hamming distance from the current two-level rule to the closest rule that correctly classifies a sample. Based on this second formulation, block coordinate descent and alternating minimization algorithms are developed. Experiments show that the two-level rules can yield noticeably better performance than one-level rules due to their dramatically larger modeling capacity, and the two algorithms based on the Hamming distance formulation are generally superior to the other two-level rule learning methods in our comparison. A proposed approach to binarize any fractional values in the optimal solutions of LP relaxations is also shown to be effective.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We introduce a novel tracking technique which uses dynamic confidence-based fusion of two different information sources for robust and efficient tracking of visual objects. Mean-shift tracking is a popular and well known method used in object tracking problems. Originally, the algorithm uses a similarity measure which is optimized by shifting a search area to the center of a generated weight image to track objects. Recent improvements on the original mean-shift algorithm involves using a classifier that differentiates the object from its surroundings. We adopt this classifier-based approach and propose an application of a classifier fusion technique within this classifier-based context in this work. We use two different classifiers, where one comes from a background modeling method, to generate the weight image and we calculate contributions of the classifiers dynamically using their confidences to generate a final weight image to be used in tracking. The contributions of the classifiers are calculated by using correlations between histograms of their weight images and histogram of a defined ideal weight image in the previous frame. We show with experiments that our dynamic combination scheme selects good contributions for classifiers for different cases and improves tracking accuracy significantly.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Multi-fidelity methods combine inexpensive low-fidelity simulations with costly but high-fidelity simulations to produce an accurate model of a system of interest at minimal cost. They have proven useful in modeling physical systems and have been applied to engineering problems such as wing-design optimization.

One concern with these experiments is that the results obtained from the online environment generalize poorly to the actual domain of interest. To address this limitation, we extend traditional multi-fidelity approaches to allow us to combine fewer data points from high-fidelity human-in-the-loop experiments with plentiful but less accurate data from low-fidelity experiments to produce accurate models of how humans interact.

5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"It becomes increasingly popular to perform mediation analysis for complex data from sophisticated experimental studies. In this paper, we present Granger Mediation Analysis (GMA), a new framework for causal mediation analysis of multiple time series. This framework is motivated by a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment where we are interested in estimating the mediation effects between a randomized stimulus time series and brain activity time series from two brain regions. The stable unit treatment assumption for causal mediation analysis is thus unrealistic for this type of time series data. To address this challenge, our framework integrates two types of models: causal mediation analysis across the variables and vector autoregressive models across the temporal observations. We further extend this framework to handle multilevel data to address individual variability and correlated errors between the mediator and the outcome variables. These models not only provide valid causal mediation for time series data but also model the causal dynamics across time. We show that the modeling parameters in our models are identifiable, and we develop computationally efficient methods to maximize the likelihood-based optimization criteria. Simulation studies show that our method reduces the estimation bias and improve statistical power, compared to existing approaches. On a real fMRI data set, our approach not only infers the causal effects of brain pathways but accurately captures the feedback effect of the outcome region on the mediator region.",0

We propose a Bayesian transfer learning framework where the source and target domains are related through the joint prior density of the model parameters. The modeling of joint prior densities enables better understanding of the ""transferability"" between domains. We define a joint Wishart density for the precision matrices of the Gaussian feature-label distributions in the source and target domains to act like a bridge that transfers the useful information of the source domain to help classification in the target domain by improving the target posteriors. Using several theorems in multivariate statistics, the posteriors and posterior predictive densities are derived in closed forms with hypergeometric functions of matrix argument, leading to our novel closed-form and fast Optimal Bayesian Transfer Learning (OBTL) classifier. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world benchmark data confirm the superb performance of the OBTL compared to the other state-of-the-art transfer learning and domain adaptation methods.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Given image labels as the only supervisory signal, we focus on harvesting, or mining, thoracic disease localizations from chest X-ray images. Harvesting such localizations from existing datasets allows for the creation of improved data sources for computer-aided diagnosis and retrospective analyses. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification and propose an attention mining (AM) strategy to improve the model's sensitivity or saliency to disease patterns. The intuition of AM is that once the most salient disease area is blocked or hidden from the CNN model, it will pay attention to alternative image regions, while still attempting to make correct predictions. However, the model requires to be properly constrained during AM, otherwise, it may overfit to uncorrelated image parts and forget the valuable knowledge that it has learned from the original image classification task. To alleviate such side effects, we then design a knowledge preservation (KP) loss, which minimizes the discrepancy between responses for X-ray images from the original and the updated networks. Furthermore, we modify the CNN model to include multi-scale aggregation (MSA), improving its localization ability on small-scale disease findings, e.g., lung nodules. We experimentally validate our method on the publicly-available ChestX-ray14 dataset, outperforming a class activation map (CAM)-based approach, and demonstrating the value of our novel framework for mining disease locations.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We present optimal competitive algorithms for two interrelated known problems involving Steiner Arborescence. One is the continuous problem of the Symmetric Rectilinear Steiner Arborescence (SRSA), studied by Berman and Coulston.   A very related, but discrete problem (studied separately in the past) is the online Multimedia Content Delivery (MCD) problem on line networks, presented originally by Papadimitriu, Ramanathan, and Rangan. An efficient content delivery was modeled as a low cost Steiner arborescence in a grid of network*time they defined. We study here the version studied by Charikar, Halperin, and Motwani (who used the same problem definitions, but removed some constraints on the inputs).   The bounds on the competitive ratios introduced separately in the above papers are similar for the two problems: O(log N) for the continuous problem and O(log n) for the network problem, where N was the number of terminals to serve, and n was the size of the network. The lower bounds were Omega(sqrt{log N}) and Omega(sqrt{log n}) correspondingly. Berman and Coulston conjectured that both the upper bound and the lower bound could be improved.   We disprove this conjecture and close these quadratic gaps for both problems. We first present an O(sqrt{log n}) deterministic competitive algorithm for MCD on the line, matching the lower bound. We then translate this algorithm to become a competitive optimal algorithm O(sqrt{log N}) for SRSA. Finally, we translate the latter back to solve MCD problem, this time competitive optimally even in the case that the number of requests is small (that is, O(min{sqrt{log n},sqrt{log N}})). We also present a Omega(sqrt[3]{log n}) lower bound on the competitiveness of any randomized algorithm. Some of the techniques may be useful in other contexts.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Many text classification tasks are known to be highly domain-dependent. Unfortunately, the availability of training data can vary drastically across domains. Worse still, for some domains there may not be any annotated data at all. In this work, we propose a multinomial adversarial network (MAN) to tackle the text classification problem in this real-world multidomain setting (MDTC). We provide theoretical justifications for the MAN framework, proving that different instances of MANs are essentially minimizers of various f-divergence metrics (Ali and Silvey, 1966) among multiple probability distributions. MANs are thus a theoretically sound generalization of traditional adversarial networks that discriminate over two distributions. More specifically, for the MDTC task, MAN learns features that are invariant across multiple domains by resorting to its ability to reduce the divergence among the feature distributions of each domain. We present experimental results showing that MANs significantly outperform the prior art on the MDTC task. We also show that MANs achieve state-of-the-art performance for domains with no labeled data.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We consider inference about a scalar parameter under a non-parametric model based on a one-step estimator computed as a plug in estimator plus the empirical mean of an estimator of the parameter's influence function. We focus on a class of parameters that have influence function which depends on two infinite dimensional nuisance functions and such that the bias of the one-step estimator of the parameter of interest is the expectation of the product of the estimation errors of the two nuisance functions. Our class includes many important treatment effect contrasts of interest in causal inference and econometrics, such as ATE, ATT, an integrated causal contrast with a continuous treatment, and the mean of an outcome missing not at random. We propose estimators of the target parameter that entertain approximately sparse regression models for the nuisance functions allowing for the number of potential confounders to be even larger than the sample size. By employing sample splitting, cross-fitting and $\ell_1$-regularized regression estimators of the nuisance functions based on objective functions whose directional derivatives agree with those of the parameter's influence function, we obtain estimators of the target parameter with two desirable robustness properties: (1) they are rate doubly-robust in that they are root-n consistent and asymptotically normal when both nuisance functions follow approximately sparse models, even if one function has a very non-sparse regression coefficient, so long as the other has a sufficiently sparse regression coefficient, and (2) they are model doubly-robust in that they are root-n consistent and asymptotically normal even if one of the nuisance functions does not follow an approximately sparse model so long as the other nuisance function follows an approximately sparse model with a sufficiently sparse regression coefficient.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Power meters are becoming a widely used tool for measuring training and racing effort in cycling, and are now spreading also to other sports. This means that increasing volumes of data can be collected from athletes, with the aim of helping coaches and athletes analyse and understanding training load, racing efforts, technique etc. In this project, we have collaborated with Skisens AB, a company producing handles for cross country ski poles equipped with power meters. We have conducted a pilot study in the use of machine learning techniques on data from Skisens poles to identify which ""gear"" a skier is using (double poling or gears 2-4 in skating), based only on the sensor data from the ski poles. The dataset for this pilot study contained labelled time-series data from three individual skiers using four different gears recorded in varied locations and varied terrain. We systematically evaluated a number of machine learning techniques based on neural networks with best results obtained by a LSTM network (accuracy of 95% correctly classified strokes), when a subset of data from all three skiers was used for training. As expected, accuracy dropped to 78% when the model was trained on data from only two skiers and tested on the third. To achieve better generalisation to individuals not appearing in the training set more data is required, which is ongoing work.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We study deep neural networks and their use in semiparametric inference. We establish novel rates of convergence for deep feedforward neural nets. Our new rates are sufficiently fast (in some cases minimax optimal) to allow us to establish valid second-step inference after first-step estimation with deep learning, a result also new to the literature. Our estimation rates and semiparametric inference results handle the current standard architecture: fully connected feedforward neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons), with the now-common rectified linear unit activation function and a depth explicitly diverging with the sample size. We discuss other architectures as well, including fixed-width, very deep networks. We establish nonasymptotic bounds for these deep nets for a general class of nonparametric regression-type loss functions, which includes as special cases least squares, logistic regression, and other generalized linear models. We then apply our theory to develop semiparametric inference, focusing on causal parameters for concreteness, such as treatment effects, expected welfare, and decomposition effects. Inference in many other semiparametric contexts can be readily obtained. We demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning with a Monte Carlo analysis and an empirical application to direct mail marketing.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We are in the middle of a remarkable rise in the use and capability of artificial intelligence. Much of this growth has been fueled by the success of deep learning architectures: models that map from observables to outputs via multiple layers of latent representations. These deep learning algorithms are effective tools for unstructured prediction, and they can be combined in AI systems to solve complex automated reasoning problems. This paper provides a recipe for combining ML algorithms to solve for causal effects in the presence of instrumental variables -- sources of treatment randomization that are conditionally independent from the response. We show that a flexible IV specification resolves into two prediction tasks that can be solved with deep neural nets: a first-stage network for treatment prediction and a second-stage network whose loss function involves integration over the conditional treatment distribution. This Deep IV framework imposes some specific structure on the stochastic gradient descent routine used for training, but it is general enough that we can take advantage of off-the-shelf ML capabilities and avoid extensive algorithm customization. We outline how to obtain out-of-sample causal validation in order to avoid over-fit. We also introduce schemes for both Bayesian and frequentist inference: the former via a novel adaptation of dropout training, and the latter via a data splitting routine.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"This study explores the use of photometric techniques (shape-from-shading and uncalibrated photometric stereo) for upsampling the low-resolution depth map from an RGB-D sensor to the higher resolution of the companion RGB image. A single-shot variational approach is first put forward, which is effective as long as the target's reflectance is piecewise-constant. It is then shown that this dependency upon a specific reflectance model can be relaxed by focusing on a specific class of objects (e.g., faces), and delegate reflectance estimation to a deep neural network. A multi-shot strategy based on randomly varying lighting conditions is eventually discussed. It requires no training or prior on the reflectance, yet this comes at the price of a dedicated acquisition setup. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on synthetic and real-world scenarios.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Despite the major advances taken in causal modeling, causality is still an unfamiliar topic for many statisticians. In this paper, it is demonstrated from the beginning to the end how causal effects can be estimated from observational data assuming that the causal structure is known. To make the problem more challenging, the causal effects are highly nonlinear and the data are missing at random. The tools used in the estimation include causal models with design, causal calculus, multiple imputation and generalized additive models. The main message is that a trained statistician can estimate causal effects by judiciously combining existing tools.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Machine learning has shown much promise in helping improve the quality of medical, legal, and financial decision-making. In these applications, machine learning models must satisfy two important criteria: (i) they must be causal, since the goal is typically to predict individual treatment effects, and (ii) they must be interpretable, so that human decision makers can validate and trust the model predictions. There has recently been much progress along each direction independently, yet the state-of-the-art approaches are fundamentally incompatible. We propose a framework for learning interpretable models from observational data that can be used to predict individual treatment effects (ITEs). In particular, our framework converts any supervised learning algorithm into an algorithm for estimating ITEs. Furthermore, we prove an error bound on the treatment effects predicted by our model. Finally, in an experiment on real-world data, we show that the models trained using our framework significantly outperform a number of baselines.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"With the development of the Internet, natural language processing (NLP), in which sentiment analysis is an important task, became vital in information processing.Sentiment analysis includes aspect sentiment classification. Aspect sentiment can provide complete and in-depth results with increased attention on aspect-level. Different context words in a sentence influence the sentiment polarity of a sentence variably, and polarity varies based on the different aspects in a sentence. Take the sentence, 'I bought a new camera. The picture quality is amazing but the battery life is too short.'as an example. If the aspect is picture quality, then the expected sentiment polarity is 'positive', if the battery life aspect is considered, then the sentiment polarity should be 'negative'; therefore, aspect is important to consider when we explore aspect sentiment in the sentence. Recurrent neural network (RNN) is regarded as a good model to deal with natural language processing, and RNNs has get good performance on aspect sentiment classification including Target-Dependent LSTM (TD-LSTM) ,Target-Connection LSTM (TC-LSTM) (Tang, 2015a, b), AE-LSTM, AT-LSTM, AEAT-LSTM (Wang et al., 2016).There are also extensive literatures on sentiment classification utilizing convolutional neural network, but there is little literature on aspect sentiment classification using convolutional neural network. In our paper, we develop attention-based input layers in which aspect information is considered by input layer. We then incorporate attention-based input layers into convolutional neural network (CNN) to introduce context words information. In our experiment, incorporating aspect information into CNN improves the latter's aspect sentiment classification performance without using syntactic parser or external sentiment lexicons in a benchmark dataset from Twitter but get better performance compared with other models.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Since the introduction of Direct Electron Detectors (DEDs), the resolution and range of macromolecules amenable to this technique has significantly widened, generating a broad interest that explains the well over a dozen reviews in top journal in the last two years. Similarly, the number of job offers to lead EM groups and/or coordinate EM facilities has exploded, and FEI (the main microscope manufacturer for Life Sciences) has received more than 100 orders of high-end electron microscopes by summer 2016. Strategic corporate movements are also happening, with very big players entering the market through key acquisitions (Thermo Fisher has recently bought FEI for \$4.2B), partly attracted by new Pharma interest in the field, now perceived to be in a position to impact structure-based drug design. The scientific perspectives are indeed extremely positive but, in these moments of well-founded generalized optimists, we want to make a reflection on some of the hurdles ahead us, since they certainly exist and they indeed limit the informational content of cryoEM projects. Here we focus on image processing aspects, particularly in the so-called area of Single Particle Analysis, discussing some of the current resolution and high-throughput limiting factors.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Layer normalization is a recently introduced technique for normalizing the activities of neurons in deep neural networks to improve the training speed and stability. In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique called Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling in speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting parameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the acoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel noises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed approach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information such as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically generates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep bidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets for large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The experimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms of transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and environments.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We study a well known noisy model of the graph isomorphism problem. In this model, the goal is to perfectly recover the vertex correspondence between two edge-correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, with an initial seed set of correctly matched vertex pairs revealed as side information. For seeded problems, our result provides a significant improvement over previously known results. We show that it is possible to achieve the information-theoretic limit of graph sparsity in time polynomial in the number of vertices $n$. Moreover, we show the number of seeds needed for exact recovery in polynomial-time can be as low as $n^{3\epsilon}$ in the sparse graph regime (with the average degree smaller than $n^{\epsilon}$) and $\Omega(\log n)$ in the dense graph regime.   Our results also shed light on the unseeded problem. In particular, we give sub-exponential time algorithms for sparse models and an $n^{O(\log n)}$ algorithm for dense models for some parameters, including some that are not covered by recent results of Barak et al.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We consider basic conceptual questions concerning the relationship between statistical estimation and causal inference. Firstly, we show how to translate causal inference problems into an abstract statistical formalism without requiring any structure beyond an arbitrarily-indexed family of probability models. The formalism is simple but can incorporate a variety of causal modelling frameworks, including 'structural causal models', but also models expressed in terms of, e.g., differential equations. We focus primarily on the structural/graphical causal modelling literature, however. Secondly, we consider the extent to which causal and statistical concerns can be cleanly separated, examining the fundamental question: 'What can be estimated from data?'. We call this the problem of estimability. We approach this by analysing a standard formal definition of 'can be estimated' commonly adopted in the causal inference literature -- identifiability -- in our abstract statistical formalism. We use elementary category theory to show that identifiability implies the existence of a Fisher-consistent estimator, but also show that this estimator may be discontinuous, and thus unstable, in general. This difficulty arises because the causal inference problem is, in general, an ill-posed inverse problem. Inverse problems have three conditions which must be satisfied to be considered well-posed: existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions. Here identifiability corresponds to the question of uniqueness; in contrast, we take estimability to mean satisfaction of all three conditions, i.e. well-posedness. Lack of stability implies that naive translation of a causally identifiable quantity into an achievable statistical estimation target may prove impossible. Our article is primarily expository and aimed at unifying ideas from multiple fields, though we provide new constructions and proofs.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"I propose the purpose our concept of actual causation serves is minimizing various cost in intervention practice. Actual causation has three features: nonredundant sufficiency, continuity and abnormality; these features correspond to the minimization of exploitative cost, exploratory cost and risk cost in intervention practice. Incorporating these three features, a definition of actual causation is given. I test the definition in 66 causal cases from actual causation literature and show that this definition's application fit intuition better than some other causal modelling based definitions.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We consider how an agent should update her beliefs when her beliefs are represented by a set P of probability distributions, given that the agent makes decisions using the minimax criterion, perhaps the best-studied and most commonly-used criterion in the literature. We adopt a game-theoretic framework, where the agent plays against a bookie, who chooses some distribution from P. We consider two reasonable games that differ in what the bookie knows when he makes his choice. Anomalies that have been observed before, like time inconsistency, can be understood as arising because different games are being played, against bookies with different information. We characterize the important special cases in which the optimal decision rules according to the minimax criterion amount to either conditioning or simply ignoring the information. Finally, we consider the relationship between updating and calibration when uncertainty is described by sets of probabilities. Our results emphasize the key role of the rectangularity condition of Epstein and Schneider.",0
5,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We propose a recurrent neural network architecture with a Forward Kinematics layer and cycle consistency based adversarial training objective for unsupervised motion retargetting. Our network captures the high-level properties of an input motion by the forward kinematics layer, and adapts them to a target character with different skeleton bone lengths (e.g., shorter, longer arms etc.). Collecting paired motion training sequences from different characters is expensive. Instead, our network utilizes cycle consistency to learn to solve the Inverse Kinematics problem in an unsupervised manner. Our method works online, i.e., it adapts the motion sequence on-the-fly as new frames are received. In our experiments, we use the Mixamo animation data to test our method for a variety of motions and characters and achieve state-of-the-art results. We also demonstrate motion retargetting from monocular human videos to 3D characters using an off-the-shelf 3D pose estimator.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Two architectures that generalize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the processing of signals supported on graphs are introduced. We start with the selection graph neural network (GNN), which replaces linear time invariant filters with linear shift invariant graph filters to generate convolutional features and reinterprets pooling as a possibly nonlinear subsampling stage where nearby nodes pool their information in a set of preselected sample nodes. A key component of the architecture is to remember the position of sampled nodes to permit computation of convolutional features at deeper layers. The second architecture, dubbed aggregation GNN, diffuses the signal through the graph and stores the sequence of diffused components observed by a designated node. This procedure effectively aggregates all components into a stream of information having temporal structure to which the convolution and pooling stages of regular CNNs can be applied. A multinode version of aggregation GNNs is further introduced for operation in large scale graphs. An important property of selection and aggregation GNNs is that they reduce to conventional CNNs when particularized to time signals reinterpreted as graph signals in a circulant graph. Comparative numerical analyses are performed in a source localization application over synthetic and real-world networks. Performance is also evaluated for an authorship attribution problem and text category classification. Multinode aggregation GNNs are consistently the best performing GNN architecture.",0

We were also able to adjust a single property without changing the others and to manipulate it beyond the range of the dataset.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph classification is a significant problem in many scientific domains. It addresses tasks such as the classification of proteins and chemical compounds into categories according to their functions, or chemical and structural properties. In a supervised setting, this problem can be framed as learning the structure, features and relationships between features within a set of labelled graphs and being able to correctly predict the labels or categories of unseen graphs.   A significant difficulty in this task arises when attempting to apply established classification algorithms due to the requirement for fixed size matrix or tensor representations of the graphs which may vary greatly in their numbers of nodes and edges. Building on prior work combining explicit tensor representations with a standard image-based classifier, we propose a model to perform graph classification by extracting fixed size tensorial information from each graph in a given set, and using a Capsule Network to perform classification.   The graphs we consider here are undirected and with categorical features on the nodes. Using standard benchmarking chemical and protein datasets, we demonstrate that our graph Capsule Network classification model using an explicit tensorial representation of the graphs is competitive with current state of the art graph kernels and graph neural network models despite only limited hyper-parameter searching.",0

It divides the problem into multiple fundamentally different tasks, which themselves are parallelized. For evaluation, we design a detailed, architecture-cognizant implementation of our scheme on a recent 72-core Knights Landing processor that is adaptive to the cache, memory, and core structure. Our library efficiently supports dense and sparse datasets as well as 4-bit quantized data for further possible gains in performance.

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"This paper presents a novel automated system that segments six sub-retinal layers from optical coherence tomography (OCT) image stacks of healthy patients and patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). First, each image in the OCT stack is denoised using a Wiener deconvolution algorithm that estimates the additive speckle noise variance using a novel Fourier-domain based structural error. This denoising method enhances the image SNR by an average of 12dB. Next, the denoised images are subjected to an iterative multi-resolution high-pass filtering algorithm that detects seven sub-retinal surfaces in six iterative steps. The thicknesses of each sub-retinal layer for all scans from a particular OCT stack are then compared to the manually marked groundtruth. The proposed system uses adaptive thresholds for denoising and segmenting each image and hence it is robust to disruptions in the retinal micro-structure due to DME. The proposed denoising and segmentation system has an average error of 1.2-5.8 $\mu m$ and 3.5-26$\mu m$ for segmenting sub-retinal surfaces in normal and abnormal images with DME, respectively. For estimating the sub-retinal layer thicknesses, the proposed system has an average error of 0.2-2.5 $\mu m$ and 1.8-18 $\mu m$ in normal and abnormal images, respectively. Additionally, the average inner sub-retinal layer thickness in abnormal images is estimated as 275$\mu m (r=0.92)$ with an average error of 9.3 $\mu m$, while the average thickness of the outer layers in abnormal images is estimated as 57.4$\mu m (r=0.74)$ with an average error of 3.5 $\mu m$.

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph similarity search is among the most important graph-based applications, e.g. finding the chemical compounds that are most similar to a query compound. Graph similarity computation, such as Graph Edit Distance (GED) and Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS), is the core operation of graph similarity search and many other applications, but very costly to compute in practice. Inspired by the recent success of neural network approaches to several graph applications, such as node or graph classification, we propose a novel neural network based approach to address this classic yet challenging graph problem, aiming to alleviate the computational burden while preserving a good performance.   The proposed approach, called SimGNN, combines two strategies. First, we design a learnable embedding function that maps every graph into a vector, which provides a global summary of a graph. A novel attention mechanism is proposed to emphasize the important nodes with respect to a specific similarity metric. Second, we design a pairwise node comparison method to supplement the graph-level embeddings with fine-grained node-level information. Our model achieves better generalization on unseen graphs, and in the worst case runs in quadratic time with respect to the number of nodes in two graphs. Taking GED computation as an example, experimental results on three real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Specifically, our model achieves smaller error rate and great time reduction compared against a series of baselines, including several approximation algorithms on GED computation, and many existing graph neural network based models. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to adopt neural networks to explicitly model the similarity between two graphs, and provide a new direction for future research on graph similarity computation and graph similarity search.",0

We focus on the class of such problems where $f$ is a proper function. This encodes many well-studied NP-hard problems such as the generalized survivable network design problem.   In this paper we present the first strongly polynomial time FPTAS for solving the LP relaxation of the standard IP formulation of the $f$-connectivity problem with general proper functions $f$. Implementing Jain's algorithm, this yields a strongly polynomial time $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation for the generalized survivable network design problem (where we consider rounding up of rationals an arithmetic operation).",0

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Predicting attention is a popular topic at the intersection of human and computer vision. However, even though most of the available video saliency data sets and models claim to target human observers' fixations, they fail to differentiate them from smooth pursuit (SP), a major eye movement type that is unique to perception of dynamic scenes. In this work, we highlight the importance of SP and its prediction (which we call supersaliency, due to greater selectivity compared to fixations), and aim to make its distinction from fixations explicit for computational models. To this end, we (i) use algorithmic and manual annotations of SP and fixations for two well-established video saliency data sets, (ii) train Slicing Convolutional Neural Networks for saliency prediction on either fixation- or SP-salient locations, and (iii) evaluate our and 26 publicly available dynamic saliency models on three data sets against traditional saliency and supersaliency ground truth. Overall, our models outperform the state of the art in both the new supersaliency and the traditional saliency problem settings, for which literature models are optimized. Importantly, on two independent data sets, our supersaliency model shows greater generalization ability and outperforms all other models, even for fixation prediction.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"We introduce SparseVM, a method that registers clinical-quality 3D MR scans both faster and more accurately than previously possible. Deformable alignment, or registration, of clinical scans is a fundamental task for many clinical neuroscience studies. However, most registration algorithms are designed for high-resolution research-quality scans. In contrast to research-quality scans, clinical scans are often sparse, missing up to 86% of the slices available in research-quality scans. Existing methods for registering these sparse images are either inaccurate or extremely slow. We present a learning-based registration method, SparseVM, that is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster than the most accurate clinical registration methods. To our knowledge, it is the first method to use deep learning specifically tailored to registering clinical images. We demonstrate our method on a clinically-acquired MRI dataset of stroke patients and on a simulated sparse MRI dataset. Our code is available as part of the VoxelMorph package at http://voxelmorph.mit.edu/.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"As renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) penetrate the power grid at an accelerating speed, it is essential for operators to have accurate solar photovoltaic (PV) energy forecasting for efficient operations and planning. Generally, observed weather data are applied in the solar PV generation forecasting model while in practice the energy forecasting is based on forecasted weather data. In this paper, a study on the uncertainty in weather forecasting for the most commonly used weather variables is presented. The forecasted weather data for six days ahead is compared with the observed data and the results of analysis are quantified by statistical metrics. In addition, the most influential weather predictors in energy forecasting model are selected. The performance of historical and observed weather data errors is assessed using a solar PV generation forecasting model. Finally, a sensitivity test is performed to identify the influential weather variables whose accurate values can significantly improve the results of energy forecasting.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"This paper describes a design that can be used for Explainable AI. The lower level is a nested ensemble of patterns created by self-organisation. The upper level is a hierarchical tree, where nodes are linked through individual concepts, so there is a transition from mixed ensemble masses to specific categories. Lower-level pattern ensembles are learned in an unsupervsised manner and then split into branches when it is clear that the category has changed. Links between the two levels define that the concepts are learned and missing links define that they are guessed only. This paper proposes some new clustering algorithms for producing the pattern ensembles, that are themselves an ensemble which converges through aggregations. Multiple solutions are also combined, to make the final result more robust. One measure of success is how coherent these ensembles are, which means that every data row in the cluster belongs to the same category. The total number of clusters is also important and the teaching phase can correct the ensemble estimates with respect to both of these. A teaching phase would then help the classifier to learn the true category for each input row. During this phase, any classifier can learn or infer correct classifications from some other classifier's knowledge, thereby reducing the required number of presentations. As the information is added, cross-referencing between the two structures allows it to be used more widely, where a unique structure can build up that would not be possible by either method separately.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Recently, progress has been made towards improving relational reasoning in machine learning field. Among existing models, graph neural networks (GNNs) is one of the most effective approaches for multi-hop relational reasoning. In fact, multi-hop relational reasoning is indispensable in many natural language processing tasks such as relation extraction. In this paper, we propose to generate the parameters of graph neural networks (GP-GNNs) according to natural language sentences, which enables GNNs to process relational reasoning on unstructured text inputs. We verify GP-GNNs in relation extraction from text. Experimental results on a human-annotated dataset and two distantly supervised datasets show that our model achieves significant improvements compared to baselines. We also perform a qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our model could discover more accurate relations by multi-hop relational reasoning.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Previous work on emotion recognition demonstrated a synergistic effect of combining several modalities such as auditory, visual, and transcribed text to estimate the affective state of a speaker. Among these, the linguistic modality is crucial for the evaluation of an expressed emotion. However, manually transcribed spoken text cannot be given as input to a system practically. We argue that using ground-truth transcriptions during training and evaluation phases leads to a significant discrepancy in performance compared to real-world conditions, as the spoken text has to be recognized on the fly and can contain speech recognition mistakes. In this paper, we propose a method of integrating an automatic speech recognition (ASR) output with a character-level recurrent neural network for sentiment recognition. In addition, we conduct several experiments investigating sentiment recognition for human-robot interaction in a noise-realistic scenario which is challenging for the ASR systems. We quantify the improvement compared to using only the acoustic modality in sentiment recognition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity (MOSI) by achieving 73,6% accuracy in a binary sentiment classification task, exceeding previously reported results that use only acoustic input. In addition, we set a new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSI dataset (80.4% accuracy, 2% absolute improvement).",0

In particular, we probe the regimes of applicability of three models of the wire: stiff and massless, elastic and massless, and elastic and massive. Using both analytical and empirical techniques, we present the conditions under which the wire's mass and elasticity can be neglected. By accounting for these effects, we measure nichrome's thermal expansion coefficient to be 17.1(1.3) ppm/K, which is consistent with the accepted value at the 8% level.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Due to its high computational speed and accuracy compared to ab-initio quantum chemistry and forcefield modeling, the prediction of molecular properties using machine learning has received great attention in the fields of materials design and drug discovery. A main ingredient required for machine learning is a training dataset consisting of molecular features\textemdash for example fingerprint bits, chemical descriptors, etc. that adequately characterize the corresponding molecules. However, choosing features for any application is highly non-trivial. No ""universal"" method for feature selection exists. In this work, we propose a data fusion framework that uses Independent Vector Analysis to exploit underlying complementary information contained in different molecular featurization methods, bringing us a step closer to automated feature generation. Our approach takes an arbitrary number of individual feature vectors and automatically generates a single, compact (low dimensional) set of molecular features that can be used to enhance the prediction performance of regression models. At the same time our methodology retains the possibility of interpreting the generated features to discover relationships between molecular structures and properties. We demonstrate this on the QM7b dataset for the prediction of several properties such as atomization energy, polarizability, frontier orbital eigenvalues, ionization potential, electron affinity, and excitation energies. In addition, we show how our method helps improve the prediction of experimental binding affinities for a set of human BACE-1 inhibitors. To encourage more widespread use of IVA we have developed the PyIVA Python package, an open source code which is available for download on Github.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Learning representation for graph classification turns a variable-size graph into a fixed-size vector (or matrix). Such a representation works nicely with algebraic manipulations. Here we introduce a simple method to augment an attributed graph with a virtual node that is bidirectionally connected to all existing nodes. The virtual node represents the latent aspects of the graph, which are not immediately available from the attributes and local connectivity structures. The expanded graph is then put through any node representation method. The representation of the virtual node is then the representation of the entire graph. In this paper, we use the recently introduced Column Network for the expanded graph, resulting in a new end-to-end graph classification model dubbed Virtual Column Network (VCN). The model is validated on two tasks: (i) predicting bio-activity of chemical compounds, and (ii) finding software vulnerability from source code. Results demonstrate that VCN is competitive against well-established rivals.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph spanners are fundamental graph structures with a wide range of applications in distributed networks. We consider a standard synchronous message passing model where in each round $O(\log n)$ bits can be transmitted over every edge (the CONGEST model).   The state of the art of deterministic distributed spanner constructions suffers from large messages. The only exception is the work of Derbel et al. '10, which computes an optimal-sized $(2k-1)$-spanner but uses $O(n^{1-1/k})$ rounds.   In this paper, we significantly improve this bound. We present a deterministic distributed algorithm that given an unweighted $n$-vertex graph $G = (V, E)$ and a parameter $k > 2$, constructs a $(2k-1)$-spanner with $O(k \cdot n^{1+1/k})$ edges within $O(2^{k} \cdot n^{1/2 - 1/k})$ rounds for every even $k$. For odd $k$, the number of rounds is $O(2^{k} \cdot n^{1/2 - 1/(2k)})$. For the weighted case, we provide the first deterministic construction of a $3$-spanner with $O(n^{3/2})$ edges that uses $O(\log n)$-size messages and $\widetilde{O}(1)$ rounds. If the nodes have IDs in $[1, \Theta(n)]$, then the algorithm works in only $2$ rounds!",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"While invasively recorded brain activity is known to provide detailed information on motor commands, it is an open question at what level of detail information about positions of body parts can be decoded from non-invasively acquired signals. In this work it is shown that index finger positions can be differentiated from non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in healthy human subjects. Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation procedure, a random forest distinguished different index finger positions on a numerical keyboard above chance-level accuracy. Among the different spectral features investigated, high $\beta$-power (20-30 Hz) over contralateral sensorimotor cortex carried most information about finger position. Thus, these findings indicate that finger position is in principle decodable from non-invasive features of brain activity that generalize across individuals.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Similarity search over chemical compound databases is a fundamental task in the discovery and design of novel drug-like molecules. Such databases often encode molecules as non-negative integer vectors, called molecular descriptors, which represent rich information on various molecular properties. While there exist efficient indexing structures for searching databases of binary vectors, solutions for more general integer vectors are in their infancy. In this paper we present a time- and space- efficient index for the problem that we call the succinct intervals-splitting tree algorithm for molecular descriptors (SITAd). Our approach extends efficient methods for binary-vector databases, and uses ideas from succinct data structures. Our experiments, on a large database of over 40 million compounds, show SITAd significantly outperforms alternative approaches in practice.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an effective framework for representation learning of graphs. GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"The quality of life of many people could be improved by autonomous humanoid robots in the home. To function in the human world, a humanoid household robot must be able to locate itself and perceive the environment like a human; scene perception, object detection and segmentation, and object spatial localization in 3D are fundamental capabilities for such humanoid robots. This paper presents a 3D multi-class object detection and segmentation method. The contributions are twofold. Firstly, we present a multi-class detection method, where a minimal joint codebook is learned in a principled manner. Secondly, we incorporate depth information using RGB-D imagery, which increases the robustness of the method and gives the 3D location of objects -- necessary since the robot reasons in 3D space. Experiments show that the multi-class extension improves the detection efficiency with respect to the number of classes and the depth extension improves the detection robustness and give sufficient natural 3D location of the objects.",0

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Deep learning architectures have proved versatile in a number of drug discovery applications, including the modelling of in vitro compound activity. While controlling for prediction confidence is essential to increase the trust, interpretability and usefulness of virtual screening models in drug discovery, techniques to estimate the reliability of the predictions generated with deep learning networks remain largely underexplored. Here, we present Deep Confidence, a framework to compute valid and efficient confidence intervals for individual predictions using the deep learning technique Snapshot Ensembling and conformal prediction. Specifically, Deep Confidence generates an ensemble of deep neural networks by recording the network parameters throughout the local minima visited during the optimization phase of a single neural network. This approach serves to derive a set of base learners (i.e., snapshots) with comparable predictive power on average, that will however generate slightly different predictions for a given instance. The variability across base learners and the validation residuals are in turn harnessed to compute confidence intervals using the conformal prediction framework. Using a set of 24 diverse IC50 data sets from ChEMBL 23, we show that Snapshot Ensembles perform on par with Random Forest (RF) and ensembles of independently trained deep neural networks. In addition, we find that the confidence regions predicted using the Deep Confidence framework span a narrower set of values. Overall, Deep Confidence represents a highly versatile error prediction framework that can be applied to any deep learning-based application at no extra computational cost.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been popularly used for analyzing non-Euclidean data such as social network data and biological data. Despite their success, the design of graph neural networks requires a lot of manual work and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Architecture Search method (GraphNAS for short) that enables automatic search of the best graph neural architecture based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, GraphNAS first uses a recurrent network to generate variable-length strings that describe the architectures of graph neural networks, and then trains the recurrent network with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation data set. Extensive experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that GraphNAS can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network. On node classification tasks, GraphNAS can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"A key goal of computational personalized medicine is to systematically utilize genomic and other molecular features of samples to predict drug responses for a previously unseen sample. Such predictions are valuable for developing hypotheses for selecting therapies tailored for individual patients. This is especially valuable in oncology, where molecular and genetic heterogeneity of the cells has a major impact on the response. However, the prediction task is extremely challenging, raising the need for methods that can effectively model and predict drug responses. In this study, we propose a novel formulation of multi-task matrix factorization that allows selective data integration for predicting drug responses. To solve the modeling task, we extend the state-of-the-art kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization (KBMF) method with component-wise multiple kernel learning. In addition, our approach exploits the known pathway information in a novel and biologically meaningful fashion to learn the drug response associations. Our method quantitatively outperforms the state of the art on predicting drug responses in two publicly available cancer data sets as well as on a synthetic data set. In addition, we validated our model predictions with lab experiments using an in-house cancer cell line panel. We finally show the practical applicability of the proposed method by utilizing prior knowledge to infer pathway-drug response associations, opening up the opportunity for elucidating drug action mechanisms. We demonstrate that pathway-response associations can be learned by the proposed model for the well known EGFR and MEK inhibitors.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Neural language models are a powerful tool to embed words into semantic vector spaces. However, learning such models generally relies on the availability of abundant and diverse training examples. In highly specialised domains this requirement may not be met due to difficulties in obtaining a large corpus, or the limited range of expression in average use. Such domains may encode prior knowledge about entities in a knowledge base or ontology. We propose a generative model which integrates evidence from diverse data sources, enabling the sharing of semantic information. We achieve this by generalising the concept of co-occurrence from distributional semantics to include other relationships between entities or words, which we model as affine transformations on the embedding space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by outperforming recent models on a link prediction task and demonstrating its ability to profit from partially or fully unobserved data training labels. We further demonstrate the usefulness of learning from different data sources with overlapping vocabularies.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Network biology has been successfully used to help reveal complex mechanisms of disease, especially cancer. On the other hand, network biology requires in-depth knowledge to construct disease-specific networks, but our current knowledge is very limited even with the recent advances in human cancer biology. Deep learning has shown a great potential to address the difficult situation like this. However, deep learning technologies conventionally use grid-like structured data, thus application of deep learning technologies to the classification of human disease subtypes is yet to be explored. Recently, graph based deep learning techniques have emerged, which becomes an opportunity to leverage analyses in network biology. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid model, which integrates two key components 1) graph convolution neural network (graph CNN) and 2) relation network (RN). We utilize graph CNN as a component to learn expression patterns of cooperative gene community, and RN as a component to learn associations between learned patterns. The proposed model is applied to the PAM50 breast cancer subtype classification task, the standard breast cancer subtype classification of clinical utility. In experiments of both subtype classification and patient survival analysis, our proposed method achieved significantly better performances than existing methods. We believe that this work is an important starting point to realize the upcoming personalized medicine.",0

While previous works generally assumed that the graph structures of samples are regular with unified dimensions, in many applications, they are highly diverse or even not well defined. Under some circumstances, e.g. chemical molecular data, clustering or coarsening for simplifying the graphs is hard to be justified chemically. In this paper, we propose a more general and flexible graph convolution network (EGCN) fed by batch of arbitrarily shaped data together with their evolving graph Laplacians trained in supervised fashion.

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a popular class of machine learning models whose major advantage is their ability to incorporate a sparse and discrete dependency structure between data points. Unfortunately, GNNs can only be used when such a graph-structure is available. In practice, however, real-world graphs are often noisy and incomplete or might not be available at all. With this work, we propose to jointly learn the graph structure and the parameters of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by approximately solving a bilevel program that learns a discrete probability distribution on the edges of the graph. This allows one to apply GCNs not only in scenarios where the given graph is incomplete or corrupted but also in those where a graph is not available. We conduct a series of experiments that analyze the behavior of the proposed method and demonstrate that it outperforms related methods by a significant margin.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Processing data collected by a network of agents often boils down to solving an optimization problem. The distributed nature of these problems calls for methods that are, themselves, distributed. While most collaborative learning problems require agents to reach a common (or consensus) model, there are situations in which the consensus solution may not be optimal. For instance, agents may want to reach a compromise between agreeing with their neighbors and minimizing a personal loss function. We present DJAM, a Jacobi-like distributed algorithm for learning personalized models. This method is implementation-friendly: it has no hyperparameters that need tuning, it is asynchronous, and its updates only require single-neighbor interactions. We prove that DJAM converges with probability one to the solution, provided that the personal loss functions are strongly convex and have Lipschitz gradient. We then give evidence that DJAM is on par with state-of-the-art methods: our method reaches a solution with error similar to the error of a carefully tuned ADMM in about the same number of single-neighbor interactions.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"We study how to synthesize novel views of human body from a single image. Though recent deep learning based methods work well for rigid objects, they often fail on objects with large articulation, like human bodies. The core step of existing methods is to fit a map from the observable views to novel views by CNNs; however, the rich articulation modes of human body make it rather challenging for CNNs to memorize and interpolate the data well. To address the problem, we propose a novel deep learning based pipeline that explicitly estimates and leverages the geometry of the underlying human body. Our new pipeline is a composition of a shape estimation network and an image generation network, and at the interface a perspective transformation is applied to generate a forward flow for pixel value transportation. Our design is able to factor out the space of data variation and makes learning at each step much easier. Empirically, we show that the performance for pose-varying objects can be improved dramatically. Our method can also be applied on real data captured by 3D sensors, and the flow generated by our methods can be used for generating high quality results in higher resolution.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"SMILES is a linear representation of chemical structures which encodes the connection table, and the stereochemistry of a molecule as a line of text with a grammar structure denoting atoms, bonds, rings and chains, and this information can be used to predict chemical properties. Molecular fingerprints are representations of chemical structures, successfully used in similarity search, clustering, classification, drug discovery, and virtual screening and are a standard and computationally efficient abstract representation where structural features are represented as a bit string. Both SMILES and molecular fingerprints are different representations for describing the structure of a molecule. There exist several predictive models for learning chemical properties based on either SMILES or molecular fingerprints. Here, our goal is to build predictive models that can leverage both these molecular representations. In this work, we present CheMixNet -- a set of neural networks for predicting chemical properties from a mixture of features learned from the two molecular representations -- SMILES as sequences and molecular fingerprints as vector inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of CheMixNet architectures by evaluating on six different datasets. The proposed CheMixNet models not only outperforms the candidate neural architectures such as contemporary fully connected networks that uses molecular fingerprints and 1-D CNN and RNN models trained SMILES sequences, but also other state-of-the-art architectures such as Chemception and Molecular Graph Convolutions.",0

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"In silico drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is an important and challenging problem in biomedical research with a huge potential benefit to the pharmaceutical industry and patients. Most existing methods for DTI prediction including deep learning models generally have binary endpoints, which could be an oversimplification of the problem, and those methods are typically unable to handle cold-target problems, i.e., problems involving target protein that never appeared in the training set. Towards this, we contrived PADME (Protein And Drug Molecule interaction prEdiction), a framework based on Deep Neural Networks, to predict real-valued interaction strength between compounds and proteins without requiring feature engineering. PADME takes both compound and protein information as inputs, so it is capable of solving cold-target (and cold-drug) problems. To our knowledge, we are the first to combine Molecular Graph Convolution (MGC) for compound featurization with protein descriptors for DTI prediction. We used multiple cross-validation split schemes and evaluation metrics to measure the performance of PADME on multiple datasets, including the ToxCast dataset, and PADME consistently dominates baseline methods. The results of a case study, which predicts the binding affinity between various compounds and androgen receptor (AR), suggest PADME's potential in drug development. The scalability of PADME is another advantage in the age of Big Data.",0

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Since the orbital angular momentum (OAM) being investigated intensively in the optical region, there are growing interests in employing OAM to solve the problem in wireless communications as a new method. It is found that the independence between different OAM modes is crucial to wireless communications. Motivated by the tremendous potential of OAM in communication systems, we propose a novel method to generate vortex beams by spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). A looped double-layer spoof SPP waveguide is applied to realize the transmission of electromagnetic waves. Beam emitting is accomplished through a series of circular patches, whose role is not only the radiation units but also resonators giving rise to the phase shifts required by the vortex beam. The proposed method is validated by both numerical calculation and experiment. The measured results show that the spoof SPPs are radiated by the circular patches and the vortex beam carrying different OAM modes are observed at different frequencies. This is the first time to generate the OAM modes by spoof SPPs. The proposed method possesses smaller size and is much easier to be integrated into integrated circuits. The simple structure and design procedure make the proposed method promising in future wireless communication systems.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"We propose a novel way to handle out of vocabulary (OOV) words in downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We implement a network that predicts useful embeddings for OOV words based on their morphology and on the context in which they appear. Our model also incorporates an attention mechanism indicating the focus allocated to the left context words, the right context words or the word's characters, hence making the prediction more interpretable. The model is a ``drop-in'' module that is jointly trained with the downstream task's neural network, thus producing embeddings specialized for the task at hand. When the task is mostly syntactical, we observe that our model aims most of its attention on surface form characters. On the other hand, for tasks more semantical, the network allocates more attention to the surrounding words. In all our tests, the module helps the network to achieve better performances in comparison to the use of simple random embeddings.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Learning fine-grained details is a key issue in image aesthetic assessment. Most of the previous methods extract the fine-grained details via random cropping strategy, which may undermine the integrity of semantic information. Extensive studies show that humans perceive fine-grained details with a mixture of foveal vision and peripheral vision. Fovea has the highest possible visual acuity and is responsible for seeing the details. The peripheral vision is used for perceiving the broad spatial scene and selecting the attended regions for the fovea. Inspired by these observations, we propose a Gated Peripheral-Foveal Convolutional Neural Network (GPF-CNN). It is a dedicated double-subnet neural network, i.e. a peripheral subnet and a foveal subnet. The former aims to mimic the functions of peripheral vision to encode the holistic information and provide the attended regions. The latter aims to extract fine-grained features on these key regions. Considering that the peripheral vision and foveal vision play different roles in processing different visual stimuli, we further employ a gated information fusion (GIF) network to weight their contributions. The weights are determined through the fully connected layers followed by a sigmoid function. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the standard AVA and Photo.net datasets for unified aesthetic prediction tasks: (i) aesthetic quality classification; (ii) aesthetic score regression; and (iii) aesthetic score distribution prediction. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Fine-grained visual recognition is challenging because it highly relies on the modeling of various semantic parts and fine-grained feature learning. Bilinear pooling based models have been shown to be effective at fine-grained recognition, while most previous approaches neglect the fact that inter-layer part feature interaction and fine-grained feature learning are mutually correlated and can reinforce each other. In this paper, we present a novel model to address these issues. First, a cross-layer bilinear pooling approach is proposed to capture the inter-layer part feature relations, which results in superior performance compared with other bilinear pooling based approaches. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical bilinear pooling framework to integrate multiple cross-layer bilinear features to enhance their representation capability. Our formulation is intuitive, efficient and achieves state-of-the-art results on the widely used fine-grained recognition datasets.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"We study the problem of tracking (causally estimating) a time sequence of sparse spatial signals with changing sparsity patterns, as well as other unknown states, from a sequence of nonlinear observations corrupted by (possibly) non-Gaussian noise. In many applications, particularly those in visual tracking, the unknown state can be split into a small dimensional part, e.g. global motion, and a spatial signal, e.g. illumination or shape deformation. The spatial signal is often well modeled as being sparse in some domain. For a long sequence, its sparsity pattern can change over time, although the changes are usually slow. To address the above problem, we propose a novel solution approach called Particle Filtered Modified-CS (PaFiMoCS). The key idea of PaFiMoCS is to importance sample for the small dimensional state vector, while replacing importance sampling by slow sparsity pattern change constrained posterior mode tracking for recovering the sparse spatial signal. We show that the problem of tracking moving objects across spatially varying illumination change is an example of the above problem and explain how to design PaFiMoCS for it. Experiments on both simulated data as well as on real videos with significant illumination changes demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm as compared with existing particle filter based tracking algorithms.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"In this work, we provide a new formulation for Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) for link prediction on graph data that addresses common challenges for biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs). We introduce a regularized attention mechanism to GCNNs that not only improves performance on clean datasets, but also favorably accommodates noise in KGs, a pervasive issue in real-world applications. Further, we explore new visualization methods for interpretable modelling and to illustrate how the learned representation can be exploited to automate dataset denoising. The results are demonstrated on a synthetic dataset, the common benchmark dataset FB15k-237, and a large biomedical knowledge graph derived from a combination of noisy and clean data sources. Using these improvements, we visualize a learned model's representation of the disease cystic fibrosis and demonstrate how to interrogate a neural network to show the potential of PPARG as a candidate therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach for recommender systems. One way to perform collaborative filtering is matrix factorization, which characterizes user preferences and item attributes using latent vectors. These latent vectors are good at capturing global features of users and items but are not strong in capturing local relationships between users or between items. In this work, we propose a method to extract the relationships between items and embed them into the latent vectors of the factorization model. This combines two worlds: matrix factorization for collaborative filtering and item embed- ding, a similar concept to word embedding in language processing. Our experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed method outperforms competing methods on top-n recommendation tasks.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Inference of user context information, including user's gender, age, marital status, location and so on, has been proven to be valuable for building context aware recommender system. However, prevalent existing studies on user context inference have two shortcommings: 1. focusing on only a single data source (e.g. Internet browsing logs, or mobile call records), and 2. ignoring the interdependence of multiple user contexts (e.g. interdependence between age and marital status), which have led to poor inference performance. To solve this problem, in this paper, we first exploit tensor outer product to fuse multiple data sources in the feature space to obtain an extensional user feature representation. Following this, by taking this extensional user feature representation as input, we propose a multiple attribute probabilistic model called MulAProM to infer user contexts that can take advantage of the interdependence between them. Our study is based on large telecommunication datasets from the local mobile operator of Shanghai, China, and consists of two data sources, 4.6 million call detail records and 7.5 million data traffic records of 8,000 mobile users, collected in the course of six months. The experimental results show that our model can outperform other models in terms of \emph{recall}, \emph{precision}, and the \emph{F1-measure}.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph signals are signals with an irregular structure that can be described by a graph. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are information processing architectures tailored to these graph signals and made of stacked layers that compose graph convolutional filters with nonlinear activation functions. Graph convolutions endow GNNs with invariance to permutations of the graph nodes' labels. In this paper, we consider the design of trainable nonlinear activation functions that take into consideration the structure of the graph. This is accomplished by using graph median filters and graph max filters, which mimic linear graph convolutions and are shown to retain the permutation invariance of GNNs. We also discuss modifications to the backpropagation algorithm necessary to train local activation functions. The advantages of localized activation function architectures are demonstrated in four numerical experiments: source localization on synthetic graphs, authorship attribution of 19th century novels, movie recommender systems and scientific article classification. In all cases, localized activation functions are shown to improve model capacity.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful tool for machine learning on graphs.GNNs combine node feature information with the graph structure by recursively passing neural messages along edges of the input graph. However, incorporating both graph structure and feature information leads to complex models, and explaining predictions made by GNNs remains unsolved. Here we propose GNNExplainer, the first general, model-agnostic approach for providing interpretable explanations for predictions of any GNN-based model on any graph-based machine learning task. Given an instance, GNNExplainer identifies a compact subgraph structure and a small subset of node features that have a crucial role in GNN's prediction. Further, GNNExplainer can generate consistent and concise explanations for an entire class of instances. We formulate GNNExplainer as an optimization task that maximizes the mutual information between a GNN's prediction and distribution of possible subgraph structures. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our approach can identify important graph structures as well as node features, and outperforms baselines by 17.1% on average. GNNExplainer provides a variety of benefits, from the ability to visualize semantically relevant structures to interpretability, to giving insights into errors of faulty GNNs.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"In recent years machine learning (ML) took bio- and cheminformatics fields by storm, providing new solutions for a vast repertoire of problems related to protein sequence, structure, and interactions analysis. ML techniques, deep neural networks especially, were proven more effective than classical models for tasks like predicting binding affinity for molecular complex. In this work we investigated the earlier stage of drug discovery process - finding druggable pockets on protein surface, that can be later used to design active molecules. For this purpose we developed a 3D fully convolutional neural network capable of binding site segmentation. Our solution has high prediction accuracy and provides intuitive representations of the results, which makes it easy to incorporate into drug discovery projects.

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common to treat patients with complex diseases and co-existing conditions. However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is limited because these complex relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality. Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal networks. Decagon predicts the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well side effects with a strong molecular basis, while on predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon creates opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient data to flag and prioritize side effects for follow-up analysis.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"This paper investigates the impact of query topology on the difficulty of answering conjunctive queries in the presence of OWL 2 QL ontologies. Our first contribution is to clarify the worst-case size of positive existential (PE), non-recursive Datalog (NDL), and first-order (FO) rewritings for various classes of tree-like conjunctive queries, ranging from linear queries to bounded treewidth queries. Perhaps our most surprising result is a superpolynomial lower bound on the size of PE-rewritings that holds already for linear queries and ontologies of depth 2. More positively, we show that polynomial-size NDL-rewritings always exist for tree-shaped queries with a bounded number of leaves (and arbitrary ontologies), and for bounded treewidth queries paired with bounded depth ontologies. For FO-rewritings, we equate the existence of polysize rewritings with well-known problems in Boolean circuit complexity. As our second contribution, we analyze the computational complexity of query answering and establish tractability results (either NL- or LOGCFL-completeness) for a range of query-ontology pairs. Combining our new results with those from the literature yields a complete picture of the succinctness and complexity landscapes for the considered classes of queries and ontologies.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"The campaign against drug abuse is fought by all countries, most notably on ATS drugs. The technical limitations of the current test kits to detect new brand of ATS drugs present a challenge to law enforcement authorities and forensic laboratories. Meanwhile, new molecular imaging devices which allowed mankind to characterize the physical 3D molecular structure have been recently introduced, and it can be used to remedy the limitations of existing drug test kits. Thus, a new type of 3D molecular structure representation technique should be developed to cater the 3D molecular structure acquired physically using these molecular imaging devices. One of the applications of image processing methods to represent a 3D image is 3D moments, and this study formulates a new 3D moments technique, namely 3D Hahn moments, to represent the 3D molecular structure of ATS drugs. The performance of the proposed technique was analysed using drug chemical structures obtained from UNODC for the ATS drugs, while non-ATS drugs are obtained randomly from ChemSpider database. The evaluation shows the technique is qualified to be further explored in the future works to be fully compatible with ATS drug identification domain.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graphs are general and powerful data representations which can model complex real-world phenomena, ranging from chemical compounds to social networks; however, effective feature extraction from graphs is not a trivial task, and much work has been done in the field of machine learning and data mining. The recent advances in graph neural networks have made automatic and flexible feature extraction from graphs possible and have improved the predictive performance significantly. In this paper, we go further with this line of research and address a more general problem of learning with a graph of graphs (GoG) consisting of an external graph and internal graphs, where each node in the external graph has an internal graph structure. We propose a dual convolutional neural network that extracts node representations by combining the external and internal graph structures in an end-to-end manner.

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Minimizing adverse reactions caused by drug-drug interactions has always been a momentous research topic in clinical pharmacology. Detecting all possible interactions through clinical studies before a drug is released to the market is a demanding task. The power of big data is opening up new approaches to discover various drug-drug interactions. However, these discoveries contain a huge amount of noise and provide knowledge bases far from complete and trustworthy ones to be utilized. Most existing studies focus on predicting binary drug-drug interactions between drug pairs but ignore other interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called PRD, to predict drug-drug interactions. The framework uses the graph embedding that can overcome data incompleteness and sparsity issues to achieve multiple DDI label prediction. First, a large-scale drug knowledge graph is generated from different sources. Then, the knowledge graph is embedded with comprehensive biomedical text into a common low dimensional space. Finally, the learned embeddings are used to efficiently compute rich DDI information through a link prediction process. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, extensive experiments were conducted on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of capability and accuracy.",0

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Many machine learning techniques have been proposed in the last few years to process data represented in graph-structured form. Graphs can be used to model several scenarios, from molecules and materials to RNA secondary structures. Several kernel functions have been defined on graphs that coupled with kernelized learning algorithms, have shown state-of-the-art performances on many tasks. Recently, several definitions of Neural Networks for Graph (GNNs) have been proposed, but their accuracy is not yet satisfying. In this paper, we propose a task-independent pre-training methodology that allows a GNN to learn the representation induced by state-of-the-art graph kernels. Then, the supervised learning phase will fine-tune this representation for the task at hand. The proposed technique is agnostic on the adopted GNN architecture and kernel function, and shows consistent improvements in the predictive performance of GNNs in our preliminary experimental results.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful neural architecture to learn vector representations of nodes and graphs in a supervised, end-to-end fashion. Up to now, GNNs have only been evaluated empirically -- showing promising results. The following work investigates GNNs from a theoretical point of view and relates them to the $1$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman graph isomorphism heuristic ($1$-WL). We show that GNNs have the same expressiveness as the $1$-WL in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic (sub-)graphs. Hence, both algorithms also have the same shortcomings. Based on this, we propose a generalization of GNNs, so-called $k$-dimensional GNNs ($k$-GNNs), which can take higher-order graph structures at multiple scales into account. These higher-order structures play an essential role in the characterization of social networks and molecule graphs. Our experimental evaluation confirms our theoretical findings as well as confirms that higher-order information is useful in the task of graph classification and regression.",0

This ensemble model outputs a FDG-PET DAT score (FPDS) between 0 and 1 denoting the probability of a subject to be clinically diagnosed with DAT based on their metabolism profile. A novel 7 group image stratification scheme is devised that groups images not only based on their associated clinical diagnosis but also on past and future trajectories of the clinical diagnoses, yielding a more continuous representation of the different stages of DAT spectrum that mimics a real-world clinical setting. The potential for using FPDS as a DAT biomarker was validated on a large number of FDG-PET images (N=2984) obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database taken across the proposed stratification, and a good classification AUC (area under the curve) of 0.78 was achieved in distinguishing between images belonging to subjects on a DAT trajectory and those images taken from subjects not progressing to a DAT diagnosis. Further, the FPDS biomarker achieved state-of-the-art performance on the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to DAT conversion prediction task with an AUC of 0.81, 0.80, 0.77 for the 2, 3, 5 years to conversion windows respectively.",0

We propose a novel spatial convolution utilizing a random walk to uncover the relations within the input, analogous to the way the standard convolution uses the spatial neighborhood of a pixel on the grid. The convolution has an intuitive interpretation, is efficient and scalable and can also be used on data with varying graph structure. Furthermore, this generalization can be applied to many standard regression or classification problems, by learning the the underlying graph. We empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed CNN on MNIST, and challenge the state-of-the-art on Merck molecular activity data set.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"We explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to model spatial processes in which there is no a priori graphical structure. Similar to finite element analysis, we assign nodes of a GNN to spatial locations and use a computational process defined on the graph to model the relationship between an initial function defined over a space and a resulting function in the same space. We use GNNs as a computational substrate, and show that the locations of the nodes in space as well as their connectivity can be optimized to focus on the most complex parts of the space. Moreover, this representational strategy allows the learned input-output relationship to generalize over the size of the underlying space and run the same model at different levels of precision, trading computation for accuracy. We demonstrate this method on a traditional PDE problem, a physical prediction problem from robotics, and learning to predict scene images from novel viewpoints.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"For quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) studies in chemoinformatics, it is important to get interpretable relationship between chemical properties and chemical features. However, the predictive power and interpretability of QSPR models are usually two different objectives that are difficult to achieve simultaneously. A deep learning architecture using molecular graph encoding convolutional neural networks (MGE-CNN) provided a universal strategy to construct interpretable QSPR models with high predictive power. Instead of using application-specific preset molecular descriptors or fingerprints, the models can be resolved using raw and pertinent features without manual intervention or selection. In this study, we developed acute oral toxicity (AOT) models of compounds using the MGE-CNN architecture as a case study. Three types of high-level predictive models: regression model (deepAOT-R), multi-classification model (deepAOT-C) and multi-task model (deepAOT-CR) for AOT evaluation were constructed. These models highly outperformed previously reported models. For the two external datasets containing 1673 (test set I) and 375 (test set II) compounds, the R2 and mean absolute error (MAE) of deepAOT-R on the test set I were 0.864 and 0.195, and the prediction accuracy of deepAOT-C was 95.5% and 96.3% on the test set I and II, respectively.

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"In this work it is shown how to obtain, in a simple way, localized (non- diffractive) subluminal pulses as exact analytic solutions to the wave equations. These new ideal subluminal solutions, which propagate without distortion in any homogeneous linear media, are herein obtained for arbitrarily chosen frequencies and bandwidths, avoiding in particular any recourse to the non-causal components so frequently plaguing the previously known localized waves. The new solutions are suitable superpositions of --zeroth-order, in general-- Bessel beams, which can be performed either by integrating with respect to (w.r.t.) the angular frequency, or by integrating w.r.t. the longitudinal wavenumber: Both methods are expounded in this paper. The first one appears to be powerful enough; we study the second method as well, however, since it allows dealing even with the limiting case of zero-speed solutions (and furnishes a new way, in terms of continuous spectra, for obtaining the so-called ""Frozen Waves"", so promising also from the point of view of applications). We briefly treat the case, moreover, of non-axially symmetric solutions, in terms of higher order Bessel beams. At last, particular attention is paid to the role of Special Relativity, and to the fact that the localized waves are expected to be transformed one into the other by suitable Lorentz Transformations. The analogous pulses with intrinsic finite energy, or merely truncated, will be constructed in another paper. In this work we fix our attention especially on electromagnetism and optics: but results of the present kind are valid whenever an essential role is played by a wave-equation (like in acoustics, seismology, geophysics, gravitation, elementary particle physics, etc.)",0

We demonstrate that the properties of the generated molecules correlate very well with the properties of the molecules used to train the model. In order to enrich libraries with molecules active towards a given biological target, we propose to fine-tune the model with small sets of molecules, which are known to be active against that target.   Against Staphylococcus aureus, the model reproduced 14% of 6051 hold-out test molecules that medicinal chemists designed, whereas against Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria) it reproduced 28% of 1240 test molecules.

Then, a deep neural network for multi-frame in-loop filter (named MIF-Net) is developed to enhance the quality of each encoded frame by utilizing the spatial information of this frame and the temporal information of its neighboring higher-quality frames.

6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) plays a key role in predicting candidate drugs, toxicity, therapeutic effects, and biological functions. In various types of chemical analyses, computational approaches are often required due to the amount of data that needs to be handled. The recent remarkable growth and outstanding performance of deep learning have attracted considerable research attention. However,even in state-of-the-art drug analysis methods, deep learning continues to be used only as a classifier, although deep learning is capable of not only simple classification but also automated feature extraction. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end learning method for CCI, named DeepCCI. Hidden features are derived from a simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES), which is a string notation representing the chemical structure, instead of learning from crafted features. To discover hidden representations for the SMILES strings, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To guarantee the commutative property for homogeneous interaction, we apply model sharing and hidden representation merging techniques. The performance of DeepCCI was compared with a plain deep classifier and conventional machine learning methods. The proposed DeepCCI showed the best performance in all seven evaluation metrics used. In addition, the commutative property was experimentally validated. The automatically extracted features through end-to-end SMILES learning alleviates the significant efforts required for manual feature engineering. It is expected to improve prediction performance, in drug analyses.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"We address a fundamental problem in chemistry known as chemical reaction product prediction. Our main insight is that the input reactant and reagent molecules can be jointly represented as a graph, and the process of generating product molecules from reactant molecules can be formulated as a sequence of graph transformations. To this end, we propose Graph Transformation Policy Network (GTPN) -- a novel generic method that combines the strengths of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to learn the reactions directly from data with minimal chemical knowledge. Compared to previous methods, GTPN has some appealing properties such as: end-to-end learning, and making no assumption about the length or the order of graph transformations. In order to guide model search through the complex discrete space of sets of bond changes effectively, we extend the standard policy gradient loss by adding useful constraints. Evaluation results show that GTPN improves the top-1 accuracy over the current state-of-the-art method by about 3% on the large USPTO dataset.

We describe molecular ""graph convolutions"", a machine learning architecture for learning from undirected graphs, specifically small molecules. Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular graph---atoms, bonds, distances, etc.---which allows the model to take greater advantage of information in the graph structure.

Applications of spectral GCNs have been successful, but limited to a few problems where the graph is fixed, such as shape correspondence and node classification. In this work, we address this limitation by revisiting a particular family of spectral graph networks, Chebyshev GCNs, showing its efficacy in solving graph classification tasks with a variable graph structure and size. Chebyshev GCNs restrict graphs to have at most one edge between any pair of nodes. To this end, we propose a novel multigraph network that learns from multi-relational graphs.

Using machine learning techniques, we accurately predict pairwise interactions, which can be of medical and biological importance. Graphs are are useful in this problem for their generality to all types of molecules, due to the inherent association of atoms through atomic bonds. Subgraphs can represent different molecular domains. These domains can be biologically significant as most molecules only have portions that are of functional significance and can interact with other domains. Thus, we use subgraphs as features in different machine learning algorithms to predict if two drugs interact and predict potential single molecule effects.",0

Computational techniques can be used to predict potential drug-drug interactions. We approach the drug-drug interaction prediction problem as a link prediction problem and present two novel methods for drug-drug interaction prediction based on artificial neural networks and factor propagation over graph nodes: adjacency matrix factorization (AMF) and adjacency matrix factorization with propagation (AMFP). We conduct a retrospective analysis by training our models on a previous release of the DrugBank database with 1,141 drugs and 45,296 drug-drug interactions and evaluate the results on a later version of DrugBank with 1,440 drugs and 248,146 drug-drug interactions. Additionally, we perform a holdout analysis using DrugBank. We report an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score of 0.807 and 0.990 for the retrospective and holdout analyses respectively. Finally, we create an ensemble-based classifier using AMF, AMFP, and existing link prediction methods and obtain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.814 and 0.991 for the retrospective and the holdout analyses. We demonstrate that AMF and AMFP provide state of the art results compared to existing methods and that the ensemble-based classifier improves the performance by combining various predictors. These results suggest that AMF, AMFP, and the proposed ensemble-based classifier can provide important information during drug development and regarding drug prescription given only partial or noisy data. These methods can also be used to solve other link prediction problems. Drug embeddings (compressed representations) created when training our models using the interaction network have been made public.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Computers are increasingly used to make decisions that have significant impact in people's lives. Often, these predictions can affect different population subgroups disproportionately. As a result, the issue of fairness has received much recent interest, and a number of fairness-enhanced classifiers and predictors have appeared in the literature. This paper seeks to study the following questions: how do these different techniques fundamentally compare to one another, and what accounts for the differences? Specifically, we seek to bring attention to many under-appreciated aspects of such fairness-enhancing interventions. Concretely, we present the results of an open benchmark we have developed that lets us compare a number of different algorithms under a variety of fairness measures, and a large number of existing datasets. We find that although different algorithms tend to prefer specific formulations of fairness preservations, many of these measures strongly correlate with one another. In addition, we find that fairness-preserving algorithms tend to be sensitive to fluctuations in dataset composition (simulated in our benchmark by varying training-test splits), indicating that fairness interventions might be more brittle than previously thought.",0
6,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph-structured data such as social networks, functional brain networks, gene regulatory networks, communications networks have brought the interest in generalizing deep learning techniques to graph domains. In this paper, we are interested to design neural networks for graphs with variable length in order to solve learning problems such as vertex classification, graph classification, graph regression, and graph generative tasks. Most existing works have focused on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn meaningful representations of graphs, and more recently new convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been introduced. In this work, we want to compare rigorously these two fundamental families of architectures to solve graph learning tasks. We review existing graph RNN and ConvNet architectures, and propose natural extension of LSTM and ConvNet to graphs with arbitrary size. Then, we design a set of analytically controlled experiments on two basic graph problems, i.e. subgraph matching and graph clustering, to test the different architectures. Numerical results show that the proposed graph ConvNets are 3-17% more accurate and 1.5-4x faster than graph RNNs. Graph ConvNets are also 36% more accurate than variational (non-learning) techniques. Finally, the most effective graph ConvNet architecture uses gated edges and residuality. Residuality plays an essential role to learn multi-layer architectures as they provide a 10% gain of performance.",0
