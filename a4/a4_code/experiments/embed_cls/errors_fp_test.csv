301,6,1,0,,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Convolution Neural Networks on Graphs are important generalization and extension of classical CNNs. While previous works generally assumed that the graph structures of samples are regular with unified dimensions, in many applications, they are highly diverse or even not well defined. Under some circumstances, e.g. chemical molecular data, clustering or coarsening for simplifying the graphs is hard to be justified chemically. In this paper, we propose a more general and flexible graph convolution network (EGCN) fed by batch of arbitrarily shaped data together with their evolving graph Laplacians trained in supervised fashion. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance in terms of both the acceleration of parameter fitting and the significantly improved prediction accuracy on multiple graph-structured datasets."
325,6,1,0,,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graphs are general and powerful data representations which can model complex real-world phenomena, ranging from chemical compounds to social networks; however, effective feature extraction from graphs is not a trivial task, and much work has been done in the field of machine learning and data mining. The recent advances in graph neural networks have made automatic and flexible feature extraction from graphs possible and have improved the predictive performance significantly. In this paper, we go further with this line of research and address a more general problem of learning with a graph of graphs (GoG) consisting of an external graph and internal graphs, where each node in the external graph has an internal graph structure. We propose a dual convolutional neural network that extracts node representations by combining the external and internal graph structures in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on link prediction tasks using several chemical network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
341,6,1,0,,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Molecular ""fingerprints"" encoding structural information are the workhorse of cheminformatics and machine learning in drug discovery applications. However, fingerprint representations necessarily emphasize particular aspects of the molecular structure while ignoring others, rather than allowing the model to make data-driven decisions. We describe molecular ""graph convolutions"", a machine learning architecture for learning from undirected graphs, specifically small molecules. Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular graph---atoms, bonds, distances, etc.---which allows the model to take greater advantage of information in the graph structure. Although graph convolutions do not outperform all fingerprint-based methods, they (along with other graph-based methods) represent a new paradigm in ligand-based virtual screening with exciting opportunities for future improvement."
