0,0,0,1,,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Intensive care data are valuable for improvement of health care, policy making and many other purposes. Vast amount of such data are stored in different locations, on many different devices and in different data silos. Sharing data among different sources is a big challenge due to regulatory, operational and security reasons. One potential solution is federated machine learning, which is a method that sends machine learning algorithms simultaneously to all data sources, trains models in each source and aggregates the learned models. This strategy allows utilization of valuable data without moving them. One challenge in applying federated machine learning is the possibly different distributions of data from diverse sources. To tackle this problem, we proposed an adaptive boosting method named LoAdaBoost that increases the efficiency of federated machine learning. Using intensive care unit data from hospitals, we investigated the performance of learning in IID and non-IID data distribution scenarios, and showed that the proposed LoAdaBoost method achieved higher predictive accuracy with lower computational complexity than the baseline method."
1,0,0,1,,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated Learning allows multiple parties to jointly train a deep learning model on their combined data, without any of the participants having to reveal their local data to a centralized server. This form of privacy-preserving collaborative learning however comes at the cost of a significant communication overhead during training. To address this problem, several compression methods have been proposed in the distributed training literature that can reduce the amount of required communication by up to three orders of magnitude. These existing methods however are only of limited utility in the Federated Learning setting, as they either only compress the upstream communication from the clients to the server (leaving the downstream communication uncompressed) or only perform well under idealized conditions such as iid distribution of the client data, which typically can not be found in Federated Learning. In this work, we propose Sparse Ternary Compression (STC), a new compression framework that is specifically designed to meet the requirements of the Federated Learning environment. Our experiments on four different learning tasks demonstrate that STC distinctively outperforms Federated Averaging in common Federated Learning scenarios where clients either a) hold non-iid data, b) use small batch sizes during training, or where c) the number of clients is large and the participation rate in every communication round is low. We furthermore show that even if the clients hold iid data and use medium sized batches for training, STC still behaves pareto-superior to Federated Averaging in the sense that it achieves fixed target accuracies on our benchmarks within both fewer training iterations and a smaller communication budget."
2,0,0,1,,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Electronic medical records (EMRs) supports the development of machine learning algorithms for predicting disease incidence, patient response to treatment, and other healthcare events. But insofar most algorithms have been centralized, taking little account of the decentralized, non-identically independently distributed (non-IID), and privacy-sensitive characteristics of EMRs that can complicate data collection, sharing and learning. To address this challenge, we introduced a community-based federated machine learning (CBFL) algorithm and evaluated it on non-IID ICU EMRs. Our algorithm clustered the distributed data into clinically meaningful communities that captured similar diagnoses and geological locations, and learnt one model for each community. Throughout the learning process, the data was kept local on hospitals, while locally-computed results were aggregated on a server. Evaluation results show that CBFL outperformed the baseline FL algorithm in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PR AUC), and communication cost between hospitals and the server. Furthermore, communities' performance difference could be explained by how dissimilar one community was to others."
3,0,0,1,,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"On-device machine learning (ML) enables the training process to exploit a massive amount of user-generated private data samples. To enjoy this benefit, inter-device communication overhead should be minimized. With this end, we propose federated distillation (FD), a distributed model training algorithm whose communication payload size is much smaller than a benchmark scheme, federated learning (FL), particularly when the model size is large. Moreover, user-generated data samples are likely to become non-IID across devices, which commonly degrades the performance compared to the case with an IID dataset. To cope with this, we propose federated augmentation (FAug), where each device collectively trains a generative model, and thereby augments its local data towards yielding an IID dataset. Empirical studies demonstrate that FD with FAug yields around 26x less communication overhead while achieving 95-98% test accuracy compared to FL."
4,0,0,1,,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated learning enables resource-constrained edge compute devices, such as mobile phones and IoT devices, to learn a shared model for prediction, while keeping the training data local. This decentralized approach to train models provides privacy, security, regulatory and economic benefits. In this work, we focus on the statistical challenge of federated learning when local data is non-IID. We first show that the accuracy of federated learning reduces significantly, by up to 55% for neural networks trained for highly skewed non-IID data, where each client device trains only on a single class of data. We further show that this accuracy reduction can be explained by the weight divergence, which can be quantified by the earth mover's distance (EMD) between the distribution over classes on each device and the population distribution. As a solution, we propose a strategy to improve training on non-IID data by creating a small subset of data which is globally shared between all the edge devices. Experiments show that accuracy can be increased by 30% for the CIFAR-10 dataset with only 5% globally shared data."
5,5,0,1,,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"The estimation of treatment effects is a pervasive problem in medicine. Existing methods for estimating treatment effects from longitudinal observational data assume that there are no hidden confounders, an assumption that is not testable in practice and, if it does not hold, leads to biased estimates. In this paper, we develop the Time Series Deconfounder, a method that leverages the assignment of multiple treatments over time to enable the estimation of treatment effects in the presence of multi-cause hidden confounders. The Time Series Deconfounder uses a novel recurrent neural network architecture with multitask output to build a factor model over time and infer latent variables that render the assigned treatments conditionally independent; then, it performs causal inference using these latent variables that act as substitutes for the multi-cause unobserved confounders. We provide a theoretical analysis for obtaining unbiased causal effects of time-varying exposures using the Time Series Deconfounder. Using both simulated and real data we show the effectiveness of our method in deconfounding the estimation of treatment responses over time."
6,5,0,1,,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Consider the case that one observes a single time-series, where at each time t one observes a data record O(t) involving treatment nodes A(t), possible covariates L(t) and an outcome node Y(t). The data record at time t carries information for an (potentially causal) effect of the treatment A(t) on the outcome Y(t), in the context defined by a fixed dimensional summary measure Co(t). We are concerned with defining causal effects that can be consistently estimated, with valid inference, for sequentially randomized experiments without further assumptions. More generally, we consider the case when the (possibly causal) effects can be estimated in a double robust manner, analogue to double robust estimation of effects in the i.i.d. causal inference literature. We propose a general class of averages of conditional (context-specific) causal parameters that can be estimated in a double robust manner, therefore fully utilizing the sequential randomization. We propose a targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) of these causal parameters, and present a general theorem establishing the asymptotic consistency and normality of the TMLE. We extend our general framework to a number of typically studied causal target parameters, including a sequentially adaptive design within a single unit that learns the optimal treatment rule for the unit over time. Our work opens up robust statistical inference for causal questions based on observing a single time-series on a particular unit."
7,5,0,1,,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"The estimation of optimal treatment regimes is of considerable interest to precision medicine. In this work, we propose a causal $k$-nearest neighbor method to estimate the optimal treatment regime. The method roots in the framework of causal inference, and estimates the causal treatment effects within the nearest neighborhood. Although the method is simple, it possesses nice theoretical properties. We show that the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime is universally consistent. That is, the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime will eventually learn the optimal treatment regime as the sample size increases. We also establish its convergence rate. However, the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime may suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e. performance deteriorates as dimensionality increases. To alleviate this problem, we develop an adaptive causal $k$-nearest neighbor method to perform metric selection and variable selection simultaneously. The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in simulation studies and in an analysis of a chronic depression clinical trial."
8,5,0,1,,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's outcome. The challenge is that the ""ground truth"" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine."
9,5,0,1,,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Many decisions in healthcare, business, and other policy domains are made without the support of rigorous evidence due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized experiments. Using observational data to answer causal questions is risky: subjects who receive different treatments also differ in other ways that affect outcomes. Many causal inference methods have been developed to mitigate these biases. However, there is no way to know which method might produce the best estimate of a treatment effect in a given study. In analogy to cross-validation, which estimates the prediction error of predictive models applied to a given dataset, we propose synth-validation, a procedure that estimates the estimation error of causal inference methods applied to a given dataset. In synth-validation, we use the observed data to estimate generative distributions with known treatment effects. We apply each causal inference method to datasets sampled from these distributions and compare the effect estimates with the known effects to estimate error. Using simulations, we show that using synth-validation to select a causal inference method for each study lowers the expected estimation error relative to consistently using any single method."
10,5,0,1,,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"This paper provides a link between causal inference and machine learning techniques - specifically, Classification and Regression Trees (CART) - in observational studies where the receipt of the treatment is not randomized, but the assignment to the treatment can be assumed to be randomized (irregular assignment mechanism). The paper contributes to the growing applied machine learning literature on causal inference, by proposing a modified version of the Causal Tree (CT) algorithm to draw causal inference from an irregular assignment mechanism. The proposed method is developed by merging the CT approach with the instrumental variable framework to causal inference, hence the name Causal Tree with Instrumental Variable (CT-IV). As compared to CT, the main strength of CT-IV is that it can deal more efficiently with the heterogeneity of causal effects, as demonstrated by a series of numerical results obtained on synthetic data. Then, the proposed algorithm is used to evaluate a public policy implemented by the Tuscan Regional Administration (Italy), which aimed at easing the access to credit for small firms. In this context, CT-IV breaks fresh ground for target-based policies, identifying interesting heterogeneous causal effects."
12,5,0,1,,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We discuss the relevance of the recent Machine Learning (ML) literature for economics and econometrics. First we discuss the differences in goals, methods and settings between the ML literature and the traditional econometrics and statistics literatures. Then we discuss some specific methods from the machine learning literature that we view as important for empirical researchers in economics. These include supervised learning methods for regression and classification, unsupervised learning methods, as well as matrix completion methods. Finally, we highlight newly developed methods at the intersection of ML and econometrics, methods that typically perform better than either off-the-shelf ML or more traditional econometric methods when applied to particular classes of problems, problems that include causal inference for average treatment effects, optimal policy estimation, and estimation of the counterfactual effect of price changes in consumer choice models."
14,6,0,1,,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Molecular structure-property relationships are key to molecular engineering for materials and drug discovery. The rise of deep learning offers a new viable solution to elucidate the structure-property relationships directly from chemical data. Here we show that the performance of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for the prediction of molecular properties can be improved by incorporating attention and gate mechanisms. The attention mechanism enables a GCN to identify atoms in different environments. The gated skip-connection further improves the GCN by updating feature maps at an appropriate rate. We demonstrate that the resulting attention- and gate-augmented GCN could extract better structural features related to a target molecular property such as solubility, polarity, synthetic accessibility and photovoltaic efficiency compared to the vanilla GCN. More interestingly, it identified two distinct parts of molecules as essential structural features for high photovoltaic efficiency, and each of them coincided with the areas of donor and acceptor orbitals for charge-transfer excitations, respectively. As a result, the new model could accurately predict molecular properties and place molecules with similar properties close to each other in a well-trained latent space, which is critical for successful molecular engineering."
28,6,0,1,,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"We propose a novel neural method to extract drug-drug interactions (DDIs) from texts using external drug molecular structure information. We encode textual drug pairs with convolutional neural networks and their molecular pairs with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and then we concatenate the outputs of these two networks. In the experiments, we show that GCNs can predict DDIs from the molecular structures of drugs in high accuracy and the molecular information can enhance text-based DDI extraction by 2.39 percent points in the F-score on the DDIExtraction 2013 shared task data set."
31,19,0,1,,Benchmarking time-series forecasting models (ARIMA,"In this paper we study different approaches for time series modeling. The forecasting approaches using linear models, ARIMA alpgorithm, XGBoost machine learning algorithm are described. Results of different model combinations are shown. For probabilistic modeling the approaches using copulas and Bayesian inference are considered."
32,19,0,1,,Benchmarking time-series forecasting models (ARIMA,"Forecasting time series data is an important subject in economics, business, and finance. Traditionally, there are several techniques to effectively forecast the next lag of time series data such as univariate Autoregressive (AR), univariate Moving Average (MA), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), and more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with its many variations. In particular, ARIMA model has demonstrated its outperformance in precision and accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series. With the recent advancement in computational power of computers and more importantly developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as deep learning, new algorithms are developed to forecast time series data. The research question investigated in this article is that whether and how the newly developed deep learning-based algorithms for forecasting time series data, such as ""Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)"", are superior to the traditional algorithms. The empirical studies conducted and reported in this article show that deep learning-based algorithms such as LSTM outperform traditional-based algorithms such as ARIMA model. More specifically, the average reduction in error rates obtained by LSTM is between 84 - 87 percent when compared to ARIMA indicating the superiority of LSTM to ARIMA. Furthermore, it was noticed that the number of training times, known as ""epoch"" in deep learning, has no effect on the performance of the trained forecast model and it exhibits a truly random behavior."
33,19,0,1,,Benchmarking time-series forecasting models (ARIMA,"Many applications in different domains produce large amount of time series data. Making accurate forecasting is critical for many decision makers. Various time series forecasting methods exist which use linear and nonlinear models separately or combination of both. Studies show that combining of linear and nonlinear models can be effective to improve forecasting performance. However, some assumptions that those existing methods make, might restrict their performance in certain situations. We provide a new Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)-Artificial Neural Network(ANN) hybrid method that work in a more general framework. Experimental results show that strategies for decomposing the original data and for combining linear and nonlinear models throughout the hybridization process are key factors in the forecasting performance of the methods. By using appropriate strategies, our hybrid method can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy obtained by traditional hybrid methods and also either of the individual methods used separately."
34,20,0,1,,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"Deep learning for clinical applications is subject to stringent performance requirements, which raises a need for large labeled datasets. However, the enormous cost of labeling medical data makes this challenging. In this paper, we build a cost-sensitive active learning system for the problem of intracranial hemorrhage detection and segmentation on head computed tomography (CT). We show that our ensemble method compares favorably with the state-of-the-art, while running faster and using less memory. Moreover, our experiments are done using a substantially larger dataset than earlier papers on this topic. Since the labeling time could vary tremendously across examples, we model the labeling time and optimize the return on investment. We validate this idea by core-set selection on our large labeled dataset and by growing it with data from the wild."
35,20,0,1,,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"We introduce a novel strategy for learning to extract semantically meaningful features from aerial imagery. Instead of manually labeling the aerial imagery, we propose to predict (noisy) semantic features automatically extracted from co-located ground imagery. Our network architecture takes an aerial image as input, extracts features using a convolutional neural network, and then applies an adaptive transformation to map these features into the ground-level perspective. We use an end-to-end learning approach to minimize the difference between the semantic segmentation extracted directly from the ground image and the semantic segmentation predicted solely based on the aerial image. We show that a model learned using this strategy, with no additional training, is already capable of rough semantic labeling of aerial imagery. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by finetuning this model we can achieve more accurate semantic segmentation than two baseline initialization strategies. We use our network to address the task of estimating the geolocation and geoorientation of a ground image. Finally, we show how features extracted from an aerial image can be used to hallucinate a plausible ground-level panorama."
43,21,0,1,,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"Much of the success of single agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in recent years can be attributed to the use of experience replay memories (ERM), which allow Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) to be trained efficiently through sampling stored state transitions. However, care is required when using ERMs for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL), as stored transitions can become outdated because agents update their policies in parallel [11]. In this work we apply leniency [23] to MA-DRL. Lenient agents map state-action pairs to decaying temperature values that control the amount of leniency applied towards negative policy updates that are sampled from the ERM. This introduces optimism in the value-function update, and has been shown to facilitate cooperation in tabular fully-cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. We evaluate our Lenient-DQN (LDQN) empirically against the related Hysteretic-DQN (HDQN) algorithm [22] as well as a modified version we call scheduled-HDQN, that uses average reward learning near terminal states. Evaluations take place in extended variations of the Coordinated Multi-Agent Object Transportation Problem (CMOTP) [8] which include fully-cooperative sub-tasks and stochastic rewards. We find that LDQN agents are more likely to converge to the optimal policy in a stochastic reward CMOTP compared to standard and scheduled-HDQN agents."
50,21,0,1,,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"We study the problem of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with a single joint reward signal. This class of learning problems is difficult because of the often large combined action and observation spaces. In the fully centralized and decentralized approaches, we find the problem of spurious rewards and a phenomenon we call the ""lazy agent"" problem, which arises due to partial observability. We address these problems by training individual agents with a novel value decomposition network architecture, which learns to decompose the team value function into agent-wise value functions. We perform an experimental evaluation across a range of partially-observable multi-agent domains and show that learning such value-decompositions leads to superior results, in particular when combined with weight sharing, role information and information channels."
51,21,0,1,,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative control systems.,"Decision making in multi-agent systems (MAS) is a great challenge due to enormous state and joint action spaces as well as uncertainty, making centralized control generally infeasible. Decentralized control offers better scalability and robustness but requires mechanisms to coordinate on joint tasks and to avoid conflicts. Common approaches to learn decentralized policies for cooperative MAS suffer from non-stationarity and lacking credit assignment, which can lead to unstable and uncoordinated behavior in complex environments. In this paper, we propose Strong Emergent Policy approximation (STEP), a scalable approach to learn strong decentralized policies for cooperative MAS with a distributed variant of policy iteration. For that, we use function approximation to learn from action recommendations of a decentralized multi-agent planning algorithm. STEP combines decentralized multi-agent planning with centralized learning, only requiring a generative model for distributed black box optimization. We experimentally evaluate STEP in two challenging and stochastic domains with large state and joint action spaces and show that STEP is able to learn stronger policies than standard multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, when combining multi-agent open-loop planning with centralized function approximation. The learned policies can be reintegrated into the multi-agent planning process to further improve performance."
56,25,0,1,,Multimodal generative adversarial networks for fake news detection from text and audio,"Social media are nowadays one of the main news sources for millions of people around the globe due to their low cost, easy access and rapid dissemination. This however comes at the cost of dubious trustworthiness and significant risk of exposure to 'fake news', intentionally written to mislead the readers. Automatically detecting fake news poses challenges that defy existing content-based analysis approaches. One of the main reasons is that often the interpretation of the news requires the knowledge of political or social context or 'common sense', which current NLP algorithms are still missing. Recent studies have shown that fake and real news spread differently on social media, forming propagation patterns that could be harnessed for the automatic fake news detection. Propagation-based approaches have multiple advantages compared to their content-based counterparts, among which is language independence and better resilience to adversarial attacks. In this paper we show a novel automatic fake news detection model based on geometric deep learning. The underlying core algorithms are a generalization of classical CNNs to graphs, allowing the fusion of heterogeneous data such as content, user profile and activity, social graph, and news propagation. Our model was trained and tested on news stories, verified by professional fact-checking organizations, that were spread on Twitter. Our experiments indicate that social network structure and propagation are important features allowing highly accurate (92.7% ROC AUC) fake news detection. Second, we observe that fake news can be reliably detected at an early stage, after just a few hours of propagation. Third, we test the aging of our model on training and testing data separated in time. Our results point to the promise of propagation-based approaches for fake news detection as an alternative or complementary strategy to content-based approaches."
58,43,0,1,,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"With the emergence of Web 2.0 technology and the expansion of on-line social networks, current Internet users have the ability to add their reviews, ratings and opinions on social media and on commercial and news web sites. Sentiment analysis aims to classify these reviews reviews in an automatic way. In the literature, there are numerous approaches proposed for automatic sentiment analysis for different language contexts. Each language has its own properties that makes the sentiment analysis more challenging. In this regard, this work presents a comprehensive survey of existing Arabic sentiment analysis studies, and covers the various approaches and techniques proposed in the literature. Moreover, we highlight the main difficulties and challenges of Arabic sentiment analysis, and the proposed techniques in literature to overcome these barriers."
60,43,0,1,,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"So far different studies have tackled the sentiment analysis in several domains such as restaurant and movie reviews. But, this problem has not been studied in scholarly book reviews which is different in terms of review style and size. In this paper, we propose to combine different features in order to be presented to a supervised classifiers which extract the opinion target expressions and detect their polarities in scholarly book reviews. We construct a labeled corpus for training and evaluating our methods in French book reviews. We also evaluate them on English restaurant reviews in order to measure their robustness across the domains and languages. The evaluation shows that our methods are enough robust for English restaurant reviews and French book reviews."
61,43,0,1,,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"We have explored different methods of improving the accuracy of a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis. We observed that a combination of methods like negation handling, word n-grams and feature selection by mutual information results in a significant improvement in accuracy. This implies that a highly accurate and fast sentiment classifier can be built using a simple Naive Bayes model that has linear training and testing time complexities. We achieved an accuracy of 88.80% on the popular IMDB movie reviews dataset."
62,43,0,1,,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"Sentiment analysis is a common task in natural language processing that aims to detect polarity of a text document (typically a consumer review). In the simplest settings, we discriminate only between positive and negative sentiment, turning the task into a standard binary classification problem. We compare several ma- chine learning approaches to this problem, and combine them to achieve the best possible results. We show how to use for this task the standard generative lan- guage models, which are slightly complementary to the state of the art techniques. We achieve strong results on a well-known dataset of IMDB movie reviews. Our results are easily reproducible, as we publish also the code needed to repeat the experiments. This should simplify further advance of the state of the art, as other researchers can combine their techniques with ours with little effort."
65,43,0,1,,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"This work investigates the role of factors like training method, training corpus size and thematic relevance of texts in the performance of word embedding features on sentiment analysis of tweets, song lyrics, movie reviews and item reviews. We also explore specific training or post-processing methods that can be used to enhance the performance of word embeddings in certain tasks or domains. Our empirical observations indicate that models trained with multithematic texts that are large and rich in vocabulary are the best in answering syntactic and semantic word analogy questions. We further observe that influence of thematic relevance is stronger on movie and phone reviews, but weaker on tweets and lyrics. These two later domains are more sensitive to corpus size and training method, with Glove outperforming Word2vec. ""Injecting"" extra intelligence from lexicons or generating sentiment specific word embeddings are two prominent alternatives for increasing performance of word embedding features."

69,43,0,1,,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"The advent of Web 2.0 has led to an increase in the amount of sentimental content available in the Web. Such content is often found in social media web sites in the form of movie or product reviews, user comments, testimonials, messages in discussion forums etc. Timely discovery of the sentimental or opinionated web content has a number of advantages, the most important of all being monetization. Understanding of the sentiments of human masses towards different entities and products enables better services for contextual advertisements, recommendation systems and analysis of market trends. The focus of our project is sentiment focussed web crawling framework to facilitate the quick discovery of sentimental contents of movie reviews and hotel reviews and analysis of the same. We use statistical methods to capture elements of subjective style and the sentence polarity. The paper elaborately discusses two supervised machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbour(K-NN) and Naive Bayes and compares their overall accuracy, precisions as well as recall values. It was seen that in case of movie reviews Naive Bayes gave far better results than K-NN but for hotel reviews these algorithms gave lesser, almost same accuracies."
71,43,0,1,,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"Despite the loss of semantic information, bag-of-ngram based methods still achieve state-of-the-art results for tasks such as sentiment classification of long movie reviews. Many document embeddings methods have been proposed to capture semantics, but they still can't outperform bag-of-ngram based methods on this task. In this paper, we modify the architecture of the recently proposed Paragraph Vector, allowing it to learn document vectors by predicting not only words, but n-gram features as well. Our model is able to capture both semantics and word order in documents while keeping the expressive power of learned vectors. Experimental results on IMDB movie review dataset shows that our model outperforms previous deep learning models and bag-of-ngram based models due to the above advantages. More robust results are also obtained when our model is combined with other models. The source code of our model will be also published together with this paper."
77,48,0,1,,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Few-shot Learning aims to learn classifiers for new classes with only a few training examples per class. Existing meta-learning or metric-learning based few-shot learning approaches are limited in handling diverse domains with various number of labels. The meta-learning approaches train a meta learner to predict weights of homogeneous-structured task-specific networks, requiring a uniform number of classes across tasks. The metric-learning approaches learn one task-invariant metric for all the tasks, and they fail if the tasks diverge. We propose to deal with these limitations with meta metric learning. Our meta metric learning approach consists of task-specific learners, that exploit metric learning to handle flexible labels, and a meta learner, that discovers good parameters and gradient decent to specify the metrics in task-specific learners. Thus the proposed model is able to handle unbalanced classes as well as to generate task-specific metrics. We test our approach in the `$k$-shot $N$-way' few-shot learning setting used in previous work and new realistic few-shot setting with diverse multi-domain tasks and flexible label numbers. Experiments show that our approach attains superior performances in both settings."
78,48,0,1,,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Few-shot classification consists of learning a predictive model that is able to effectively adapt to a new class, given only a few annotated samples. To solve this challenging problem, meta-learning has become a popular paradigm that advocates the ability to ""learn to adapt"". Recent works have shown, however, that simple learning strategies without meta-learning could be competitive. In this paper, we go a step further and show that by addressing the fundamental high-variance issue of few-shot learning classifiers, it is possible to significantly outperform current meta-learning techniques. Our approach consists of designing an ensemble of deep networks to leverage the variance of the classifiers, and introducing new strategies to encourage the networks to cooperate, while encouraging prediction diversity. Evaluation is conducted on the mini-ImageNet and CUB datasets, where we show that even a single network obtained by distillation yields state-of-the-art results."
81,48,0,1,,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"We study few-shot learning in natural language domains. Compared to many existing works that apply either metric-based or optimization-based meta-learning to image domain with low inter-task variance, we consider a more realistic setting, where tasks are diverse. However, it imposes tremendous difficulties to existing state-of-the-art metric-based algorithms since a single metric is insufficient to capture complex task variations in natural language domain. To alleviate the problem, we propose an adaptive metric learning approach that automatically determines the best weighted combination from a set of metrics obtained from meta-training tasks for a newly seen few-shot task. Extensive quantitative evaluations on real-world sentiment analysis and dialog intent classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art few shot learning algorithms in terms of predictive accuracy. We make our code and data available for further study."
82,48,0,1,,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Learning good feature embeddings for images often requires substantial training data. As a consequence, in settings where training data is limited (e.g., few-shot and zero-shot learning), we are typically forced to use a generic feature embedding across various tasks. Ideally, we want to construct feature embeddings that are tuned for the given task. In this work, we propose Task-Aware Feature Embedding Networks (TAFE-Nets) to learn how to adapt the image representation to a new task in a meta learning fashion. Our network is composed of a meta learner and a prediction network. Based on a task input, the meta learner generates parameters for the feature layers in the prediction network so that the feature embedding can be accurately adjusted for that task. We show that TAFE-Net is highly effective in generalizing to new tasks or concepts and evaluate the TAFE-Net on a range of benchmarks in zero-shot and few-shot learning. Our model matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art on all tasks. In particular, our approach improves the prediction accuracy of unseen attribute-object pairs by 4 to 15 points on the challenging visual attribute-object composition task."
83,48,0,1,,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Meta-learning has been proposed as a framework to address the challenging few-shot learning setting. The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, meta-learning typically uses shallow neural networks (SNNs), thus limiting its effectiveness. In this paper we propose a novel few-shot learning method called meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to adapt a deep NN for few shot learning tasks. Specifically, ""meta"" refers to training multiple tasks, and ""transfer"" is achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum for MTL. We conduct experiments using (5-class, 1-shot) and (5-class, 5-shot) recognition tasks on two challenging few-shot learning benchmarks: miniImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100. Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our meta-transfer learning approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both components contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy."
84,48,0,1,,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Traditional recognition methods typically require large, artificially-balanced training classes, while few-shot learning methods are tested on artificially small ones. In contrast to both extremes, real world recognition problems exhibit heavy-tailed class distributions, with cluttered scenes and a mix of coarse and fine-grained class distinctions. We show that prior methods designed for few-shot learning do not work out of the box in these challenging conditions, based on a new ""meta-iNat"" benchmark. We introduce three parameter-free improvements: (a) better training procedures based on adapting cross-validation to meta-learning, (b) novel architectures that localize objects using limited bounding box annotations before classification, and (c) simple parameter-free expansions of the feature space based on bilinear pooling. Together, these improvements double the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on meta-iNat while generalizing to prior benchmarks, complex neural architectures, and settings with substantial domain shift."
87,48,0,1,,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Few-shot learning remains challenging for meta-learning that learns a learning algorithm (meta-learner) from many related tasks. In this work, we argue that this is due to the lack of a good representation for meta-learning, and propose deep meta-learning to integrate the representation power of deep learning into meta-learning. The framework is composed of three modules, a concept generator, a meta-learner, and a concept discriminator, which are learned jointly. The concept generator, e.g. a deep residual net, extracts a representation for each instance that captures its high-level concept, on which the meta-learner performs few-shot learning, and the concept discriminator recognizes the concepts. By learning to learn in the concept space rather than in the complicated instance space, deep meta-learning can substantially improve vanilla meta-learning, which is demonstrated on various few-shot image recognition problems. For example, on 5-way-1-shot image recognition on CIFAR-100 and CUB-200, it improves Matching Nets from 50.53% and 56.53% to 58.18% and 63.47%, improves MAML from 49.28% and 50.45% to 56.65% and 64.63%, and improves Meta-SGD from 53.83% and 53.34% to 61.62% and 66.95%, respectively."
88,48,0,1,,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Few-shot learning focuses on learning a new visual concept with very limited labelled examples. A successful approach to tackle this problem is to compare the similarity between examples in a learned metric space based on convolutional neural networks. However, existing methods typically suffer from meta-level overfitting due to the limited amount of training tasks and do not normally consider the importance of the convolutional features of different examples within the same channel. To address these limitations, we make the following two contributions: (a) We propose a novel meta-learning approach for aggregating useful convolutional features and suppressing noisy ones based on a channel-wise attention mechanism to improve class representations. The proposed model does not require fine-tuning and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. The main novelty lies in incorporating a shared weight generation module that learns to assign different weights to the feature maps of different examples within the same channel. (b) We also introduce a simple meta-level dropout technique that reduces meta-level overfitting in several few-shot learning approaches. In our experiments, we find that this simple technique significantly improves the performance of the proposed method as well as various state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithms. Applying our method to few-shot image recognition using Omniglot and miniImageNet datasets shows that it is capable of delivering a state-of-the-art classification performance."
91,53,0,1,,Exploring the use of BERT-based architectures for named entity recognition.,"Traditional information retrieval treats named entity recognition as a pre-indexing corpus annotation task, allowing entity tags to be indexed and used during search. Named entity taggers themselves are typically trained on thousands or tens of thousands of examples labeled by humans.   However, there is a long tail of named entities classes, and for these cases, labeled data may be impossible to find or justify financially. We propose exploring named entity recognition as a search task, where the named entity class of interest is a query, and entities of that class are the relevant ""documents"". What should that query look like? Can we even perform NER-style labeling with tens of labels? This study presents an exploration of CRF-based NER models with handcrafted features and of how we might transform them into search queries."
93,57,0,1,,Attention mechanisms for question answering on long-form texts.,"Recently, the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task has gained increasing attention in artificial intelligence. Existing VQA methods mainly adopt the visual attention mechanism to associate the input question with corresponding image regions for effective question answering. The free-form region based and the detection-based visual attention mechanisms are mostly investigated, with the former ones attending free-form image regions and the latter ones attending pre-specified detection-box regions. We argue that the two attention mechanisms are able to provide complementary information and should be effectively integrated to better solve the VQA problem. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network for VQA that integrates both attention mechanisms. Our proposed framework effectively fuses features from free-form image regions, detection boxes, and question representations via a multi-modal multiplicative feature embedding scheme to jointly attend question-related free-form image regions and detection boxes for more accurate question answering. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on two publicly available datasets, COCO-QA and VQA, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Source code is available at https://github.com/lupantech/dual-mfa-vqa."
94,61,0,1,,Improving text classification using attention and memory-augmented networks.,"In this paper, we exploit a memory-augmented neural network to predict accurate answers to visual questions, even when those answers occur rarely in the training set. The memory network incorporates both internal and external memory blocks and selectively pays attention to each training exemplar. We show that memory-augmented neural networks are able to maintain a relatively long-term memory of scarce training exemplars, which is important for visual question answering due to the heavy-tailed distribution of answers in a general VQA setting. Experimental results on two large-scale benchmark datasets show the favorable performance of the proposed algorithm with a comparison to state of the art."
95,61,0,1,,Improving text classification using attention and memory-augmented networks.,"We present a memory augmented neural network for natural language understanding: Neural Semantic Encoders. NSE is equipped with a novel memory update rule and has a variable sized encoding memory that evolves over time and maintains the understanding of input sequences through read}, compose and write operations. NSE can also access multiple and shared memories. In this paper, we demonstrated the effectiveness and the flexibility of NSE on five different natural language tasks: natural language inference, question answering, sentence classification, document sentiment analysis and machine translation where NSE achieved state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on publically available benchmarks. For example, our shared-memory model showed an encouraging result on neural machine translation, improving an attention-based baseline by approximately 1.0 BLEU."
96,61,0,1,,Improving text classification using attention and memory-augmented networks.,"We perform text normalization, i.e. the transformation of words from the written to the spoken form, using a memory augmented neural network. With the addition of dynamic memory access and storage mechanism, we present a neural architecture that will serve as a language-agnostic text normalization system while avoiding the kind of unacceptable errors made by the LSTM-based recurrent neural networks. By successfully reducing the frequency of such mistakes, we show that this novel architecture is indeed a better alternative. Our proposed system requires significantly lesser amounts of data, training time and compute resources. Additionally, we perform data up-sampling, circumventing the data sparsity problem in some semiotic classes, to show that sufficient examples in any particular class can improve the performance of our text normalization system. Although a few occurrences of these errors still remain in certain semiotic classes, we demonstrate that memory augmented networks with meta-learning capabilities can open many doors to a superior text normalization system."
97,72,0,1,,Deep learning approaches for part-of-speech tagging on large datasets.,Sparsity is one of the major problems in natural language processing. The problem becomes even more severe in agglutinating languages that are highly prone to be inflected. We deal with sparsity in Turkish by adopting morphological features for part-of-speech tagging. We learn inflectional and derivational morpheme tags in Turkish by using conditional random fields (CRF) and we employ the morpheme tags in part-of-speech (PoS) tagging by using hidden Markov models (HMMs) to mitigate sparsity. Results show that using morpheme tags in PoS tagging helps alleviate the sparsity in emission probabilities. Our model outperforms other hidden Markov model based PoS tagging models for small training datasets in Turkish. We obtain an accuracy of 94.1% in morpheme tagging and 89.2% in PoS tagging on a 5K training dataset.
101,72,0,1,,Deep learning approaches for part-of-speech tagging on large datasets.,"Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a process of assigning the words in a text corresponding to a particular part of speech. A fundamental version of POS tagging is the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives etc. For processing natural languages, Part of Speech tagging is a prominent tool. It is one of the simplest as well as most constant and statistical model for many NLP applications. POS Tagging is an initial stage of linguistics, text analysis like information retrieval, machine translator, text to speech synthesis, information extraction etc. In POS Tagging we assign a Part of Speech tag to each word in a sentence and literature. Various approaches have been proposed to implement POS taggers. In this paper we present a Marathi part of speech tagger. It is morphologically rich language. Marathi is spoken by the native people of Maharashtra. The general approach used for development of tagger is statistical using Unigram, Bigram, Trigram and HMM Methods. It presents a clear idea about all the algorithms with suitable examples. It also introduces a tag set for Marathi which can be used for tagging Marathi text. In this paper we have shown the development of the tagger as well as compared to check the accuracy of taggers output. The three Marathi POS taggers viz. Unigram, Bigram, Trigram and HMM gives the accuracy of 77.38%, 90.30%, 91.46% and 93.82% respectively."
105,72,0,1,,Deep learning approaches for part-of-speech tagging on large datasets.,"In this paper, we are going to focus on speed up of the Word Sense Disambiguation procedure by filtering the relevant senses of an ambiguous word through Part-of-Speech Tagging. First, this proposed approach performs the Part-of-Speech Tagging operation before the disambiguation procedure using Bigram approximation. As a result, the exact Part-of-Speech of the ambiguous word at a particular text instance is derived. In the next stage, only those dictionary definitions (glosses) are retrieved from an online dictionary, which are associated with that particular Part-of-Speech to disambiguate the exact sense of the ambiguous word. In the training phase, we have used Brown Corpus for Part-of-Speech Tagging and WordNet as an online dictionary. The proposed approach reduces the execution time upto half (approximately) of the normal execution time for a text, containing around 200 sentences. Not only that, we have found several instances, where the correct sense of an ambiguous word is found for using the Part-of-Speech Tagging before the Disambiguation procedure."
106,74,0,1,,Recent trends in transformer-based architectures for question answering.,"Recent years have seen growing interest in conversational agents, such as chatbots, which are a very good fit for automated customer support because the domain in which they need to operate is narrow. This interest was in part inspired by recent advances in neural machine translation, esp. the rise of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) and attention-based models such as the Transformer, which have been applied to various other tasks and have opened new research directions in question answering, chatbots, and conversational systems. Still, in many cases, it might be feasible and even preferable to use simple information retrieval techniques. Thus, here we compare three different models:(i) a retrieval model, (ii) a sequence-to-sequence model with attention, and (iii) Transformer. Our experiments with the Twitter Customer Support Dataset, which contains over two million posts from customer support services of twenty major brands, show that the seq2seq model outperforms the other two in terms of semantics and word overlap."
107,74,0,1,,Recent trends in transformer-based architectures for question answering.,"The task of answering natural language questions over knowledge bases has received wide attention in recent years. Various deep learning architectures have been proposed for this task. However, architectural design choices are typically not systematically compared nor evaluated under the same conditions. In this paper, we contribute to a better understanding of the impact of architectural design choices by evaluating four different architectures under the same conditions. We address the task of answering simple questions, consisting in predicting the subject and predicate of a triple given a question. In order to provide a fair comparison of different architectures, we evaluate them under the same strategy for inferring the subject, and compare different architectures for inferring the predicate. The architecture for inferring the subject is based on a standard LSTM model trained to recognize the span of the subject in the question and on a linking component that links the subject span to an entity in the knowledge base. The architectures for predicate inference are based on i) a standard softmax classifier ranging over all predicates as output, iii) a model that predicts a low-dimensional encoding of the property given entity representation and question, iii) a model that learns to score a pair of subject and predicate given the question as well as iv) a model based on the well-known FastText model. The comparison of architectures shows that FastText provides better results than other architectures."
108,86,0,1,,Multilingual speech-to-text systems for Asian languages,"Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are becoming popular in multilingual societies. This trend induces portmanteau of South Asian languages with English. The blend of multiple languages as code-mixed data has recently become popular in research communities for various NLP tasks. Code-mixed data consist of anomalies such as grammatical errors and spelling variations. In this paper, we leverage the contextual property of words where the different spelling variation of words share similar context in a large noisy social media text. We capture different variations of words belonging to same context in an unsupervised manner using distributed representations of words. Our experiments reveal that preprocessing of the code-mixed dataset based on our approach improves the performance in state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagging (POS-tagging) and sentiment analysis tasks."
109,86,0,1,,Multilingual speech-to-text systems for Asian languages,"We present two end-to-end models: Audio-to-Byte (A2B) and Byte-to-Audio (B2A), for multilingual speech recognition and synthesis. Prior work has predominantly used characters, sub-words or words as the unit of choice to model text. These units are difficult to scale to languages with large vocabularies, particularly in the case of multilingual processing. In this work, we model text via a sequence of Unicode bytes, specifically, the UTF-8 variable length byte sequence for each character. Bytes allow us to avoid large softmaxes in languages with large vocabularies, and share representations in multilingual models. We show that bytes are superior to grapheme characters over a wide variety of languages in monolingual end-to-end speech recognition. Additionally, our multilingual byte model outperform each respective single language baseline on average by 4.4% relatively. In Japanese-English code-switching speech, our multilingual byte model outperform our monolingual baseline by 38.6% relatively. Finally, we present an end-to-end multilingual speech synthesis model using byte representations which matches the performance of our monolingual baselines."
111,90,0,1,,Efficient methods for computing similarity between embeddings,"We present a family of neural-network--inspired models for computing continuous word representations, specifically designed to exploit both monolingual and multilingual text. This framework allows us to perform unsupervised training of embeddings that exhibit higher accuracy on syntactic and semantic compositionality, as well as multilingual semantic similarity, compared to previous models trained in an unsupervised fashion. We also show that such multilingual embeddings, optimized for semantic similarity, can improve the performance of statistical machine translation with respect to how it handles words not present in the parallel data."
112,90,0,1,,Efficient methods for computing similarity between embeddings,"Neural network techniques are widely applied to obtain high-quality distributed representations of words, i.e., word embeddings, to address text mining, information retrieval, and natural language processing tasks. Recently, efficient methods have been proposed to learn word embeddings from context that captures both semantic and syntactic relationships between words. However, it is challenging to handle unseen words or rare words with insufficient context. In this paper, inspired by the study on word recognition process in cognitive psychology, we propose to take advantage of seemingly less obvious but essentially important morphological knowledge to address these challenges. In particular, we introduce a novel neural network architecture called KNET that leverages both contextual information and morphological word similarity built based on morphological knowledge to learn word embeddings. Meanwhile, the learning architecture is also able to refine the pre-defined morphological knowledge and obtain more accurate word similarity. Experiments on an analogical reasoning task and a word similarity task both demonstrate that the proposed KNET framework can greatly enhance the effectiveness of word embeddings."
114,90,0,1,,Efficient methods for computing similarity between embeddings,"We suggest a loss for learning deep embeddings. The new loss does not introduce parameters that need to be tuned and results in very good embeddings across a range of datasets and problems. The loss is computed by estimating two distribution of similarities for positive (matching) and negative (non-matching) sample pairs, and then computing the probability of a positive pair to have a lower similarity score than a negative pair based on the estimated similarity distributions. We show that such operations can be performed in a simple and piecewise-differentiable manner using 1D histograms with soft assignment operations. This makes the proposed loss suitable for learning deep embeddings using stochastic optimization. In the experiments, the new loss performs favourably compared to recently proposed alternatives."

In this work, we focus on end-to-end neural architectures and show that the best performance in text classification is obtained by combining information from different neural modules. Concretely, we combine convolution, recurrent and attention modules with ensemble methods and show that they are complementary. We introduce ECGA, an end-to-end go-to architecture for novel text classification tasks. We prove that it is efficient and robust, as it attains or surpasses the state-of-the-art on varied datasets, including both low and high data regimes."

A unified, span-extraction approach leads to superior or comparable performance in supplementary supervised pre-trained, low-data, and multi-task learning experiments on several question answering, text classification, and regression benchmarks."
118,93,0,1,,Fast algorithms for solving linear regression problems,In this note we propose a new approach towards solving numerically optimal stopping problems via reinforced regression based Monte Carlo algorithms. The main idea of the method is to reinforce standard linear regression algorithms in each backward induction step by adding new basis functions based on previously estimated continuation values. The proposed methodology is illustrated by a numerical example from mathematical finance.
119,93,0,1,,Fast algorithms for solving linear regression problems,"In recent years, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods and randomized linear algebra (RLA) algorithms have been applied to many large-scale problems in machine learning and data analysis. We aim to bridge the gap between these two methods in solving constrained overdetermined linear regression problems---e.g., $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ regression problems. We propose a hybrid algorithm named pwSGD that uses RLA techniques for preconditioning and constructing an importance sampling distribution, and then performs an SGD-like iterative process with weighted sampling on the preconditioned system. We prove that pwSGD inherits faster convergence rates that only depend on the lower dimension of the linear system, while maintaining low computation complexity. Particularly, when solving $\ell_1$ regression with size $n$ by $d$, pwSGD returns an approximate solution with $\epsilon$ relative error in the objective value in $\mathcal{O}(\log n \cdot \text{nnz}(A) + \text{poly}(d)/\epsilon^2)$ time. This complexity is uniformly better than that of RLA methods in terms of both $\epsilon$ and $d$ when the problem is unconstrained. For $\ell_2$ regression, pwSGD returns an approximate solution with $\epsilon$ relative error in the objective value and the solution vector measured in prediction norm in $\mathcal{O}(\log n \cdot \text{nnz}(A) + \text{poly}(d) \log(1/\epsilon) /\epsilon)$ time. We also provide lower bounds on the coreset complexity for more general regression problems, indicating that still new ideas will be needed to extend similar RLA preconditioning ideas to weighted SGD algorithms for more general regression problems. Finally, the effectiveness of such algorithms is illustrated numerically on both synthetic and real datasets."
120,93,0,1,,Fast algorithms for solving linear regression problems,"We describe a fast method to eliminate features (variables) in l1 -penalized least-square regression (or LASSO) problems. The elimination of features leads to a potentially substantial reduction in running time, specially for large values of the penalty parameter. Our method is not heuristic: it only eliminates features that are guaranteed to be absent after solving the LASSO problem. The feature elimination step is easy to parallelize and can test each feature for elimination independently. Moreover, the computational effort of our method is negligible compared to that of solving the LASSO problem - roughly it is the same as single gradient step. Our method extends the scope of existing LASSO algorithms to treat larger data sets, previously out of their reach. We show how our method can be extended to general l1 -penalized convex problems and present preliminary results for the Sparse Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression problems."
121,93,0,1,,Fast algorithms for solving linear regression problems,"This paper presents a fast approach for penalized least squares (LS) regression problems using a 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) prior. More precisely, the computation of the proximity operator of the LS criterion regularized by different GMRF potentials is formulated as solving a Sylvester-like matrix equation. By exploiting the structural properties of GMRFs, this matrix equation is solved columnwise in an analytical way. The proposed algorithm can be embedded into a wide range of proximal algorithms to solve LS regression problems including a convex penalty. Experiments carried out in the case of a constrained LS regression problem arising in a multichannel image processing application, provide evidence that an alternating direction method of multipliers performs quite efficiently in this context."
123,93,0,1,,Fast algorithms for solving linear regression problems,"We give improved algorithms for the $\ell_{p}$-regression problem, $\min_{x} \|x\|_{p}$ such that $A x=b,$ for all $p \in (1,2) \cup (2,\infty).$ Our algorithms obtain a high accuracy solution in $\tilde{O}_{p}(m^{\frac{|p-2|}{2p + |p-2|}}) \le \tilde{O}_{p}(m^{\frac{1}{3}})$ iterations, where each iteration requires solving an $m \times m$ linear system, $m$ being the dimension of the ambient space.   By maintaining an approximate inverse of the linear systems that we solve in each iteration, we give algorithms for solving $\ell_{p}$-regression to $1 / \text{poly}(n)$ accuracy that run in time $\tilde{O}_p(m^{\max\{\omega, 7/3\}}),$ where $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication constant. For the current best value of $\omega > 2.37$, we can thus solve $\ell_{p}$ regression as fast as $\ell_{2}$ regression, for all constant $p$ bounded away from $1.$   Our algorithms can be combined with fast graph Laplacian linear equation solvers to give minimum $\ell_{p}$-norm flow / voltage solutions to $1 / \text{poly}(n)$ accuracy on an undirected graph with $m$ edges in $\tilde{O}_{p}(m^{1 + \frac{|p-2|}{2p + |p-2|}}) \le \tilde{O}_{p}(m^{\frac{4}{3}})$ time.   For sparse graphs and for matrices with similar dimensions, our iteration counts and running times improve on the $p$-norm regression algorithm by [Bubeck-Cohen-Lee-Li STOC`18] and general-purpose convex optimization algorithms. At the core of our algorithms is an iterative refinement scheme for $\ell_{p}$-norms, using the smoothed $\ell_{p}$-norms introduced in the work of Bubeck et al. Given an initial solution, we construct a problem that seeks to minimize a quadratically-smoothed $\ell_{p}$ norm over a subspace, such that a crude solution to this problem allows us to improve the initial solution by a constant factor, leading to algorithms with fast convergence."
125,95,0,1,,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"Nearest neighbor search and k-nearest neighbor graph construction are two fundamental issues arise from many disciplines such as multimedia information retrieval, data-mining and machine learning. They become more and more imminent given the big data emerge in various fields in recent years. In this paper, a simple but effective solution both for approximate k-nearest neighbor search and approximate k-nearest neighbor graph construction is presented. These two issues are addressed jointly in our solution. On the one hand, the approximate k-nearest neighbor graph construction is treated as a search task. Each sample along with its k-nearest neighbors are joined into the k-nearest neighbor graph by performing the nearest neighbor search sequentially on the graph under construction. On the other hand, the built k-nearest neighbor graph is used to support k-nearest neighbor search. Since the graph is built online, the dynamic update on the graph, which is not possible from most of the existing solutions, is supported. This solution is feasible for various distance measures. Its effectiveness both as k-nearest neighbor construction and k-nearest neighbor search approaches is verified across different types of data in different scales, various dimensions and under different metrics."

Learning to hash is one of the major solutions to this problem and has been widely studied recently. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the learning to hash algorithms, categorize them according to the manners of preserving the similarities into: pairwise similarity preserving, multiwise similarity preserving, implicit similarity preserving, as well as quantization, and discuss their relations. We separate quantization from pairwise similarity preserving as the objective function is very different though quantization, as we show, can be derived from preserving the pairwise similarities. In addition, we present the evaluation protocols, and the general performance analysis, and point out that the quantization algorithms perform superiorly in terms of search accuracy, search time cost, and space cost.

139,95,0,1,,Approximate nearest neighbors for efficient similarity search,"Introduction. Neural network models of autoassociative, distributed memory allow storage and retrieval of many items (vectors) where the number of stored items can exceed the vector dimension (the number of neurons in the network). This opens the possibility of a sublinear time search (in the number of stored items) for approximate nearest neighbors among vectors of high dimension. The purpose of this paper is to review models of autoassociative, distributed memory that can be naturally implemented by neural networks (mainly with local learning rules and iterative dynamics based on information locally available to neurons). Scope. The survey is focused mainly on the networks of Hopfield, Willshaw and Potts, that have connections between pairs of neurons and operate on sparse binary vectors. We discuss not only autoassociative memory, but also the generalization properties of these networks. We also consider neural networks with higher-order connections and networks with a bipartite graph structure for non-binary data with linear constraints. Conclusions. In conclusion we discuss the relations to similarity search, advantages and drawbacks of these techniques, and topics for further research. An interesting and still not completely resolved question is whether neural autoassociative memories can search for approximate nearest neighbors faster than other index structures for similarity search, in particular for the case of very high dimensional vectors."
