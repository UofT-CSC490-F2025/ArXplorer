146,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are distributed (unevenly) over an extremely large number of \nodes, but the goal remains to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of utmost importance.   A motivating example for federated optimization arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices rather than logging it to a data center for training. Instead, the mobile devices are used as nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have an extremely large number of devices in our network, each of which has only a tiny fraction of data available totally; in particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, we assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution.   We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of federated optimization."
150,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning.   We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent."
162,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Communication on heterogeneous edge networks is a fundamental bottleneck in Federated Learning (FL), restricting both model capacity and user participation. To address this issue, we introduce two novel strategies to reduce communication costs: (1) the use of lossy compression on the global model sent server-to-client; and (2) Federated Dropout, which allows users to efficiently train locally on smaller subsets of the global model and also provides a reduction in both client-to-server communication and local computation. We empirically show that these strategies, combined with existing compression approaches for client-to-server communication, collectively provide up to a $14\times$ reduction in server-to-client communication, a $1.7\times$ reduction in local computation, and a $28\times$ reduction in upload communication, all without degrading the quality of the final model. We thus comprehensively reduce FL's impact on client device resources, allowing higher capacity models to be trained, and a more diverse set of users to be reached."
166,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Tensor factorization models offer an effective approach to convert massive electronic health records into meaningful clinical concepts (phenotypes) for data analysis. These models need a large amount of diverse samples to avoid population bias. An open challenge is how to derive phenotypes jointly across multiple hospitals, in which direct patient-level data sharing is not possible (e.g., due to institutional policies). In this paper, we developed a novel solution to enable federated tensor factorization for computational phenotyping without sharing patient-level data. We developed secure data harmonization and federated computation procedures based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Using this method, the multiple hospitals iteratively update tensors and transfer secure summarized information to a central server, and the server aggregates the information to generate phenotypes. We demonstrated with real medical datasets that our method resembles the centralized training model (based on combined datasets) in terms of accuracy and phenotypes discovery while respecting privacy."
168,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning approach which enables model training on a large corpus of decentralized data. We have built a scalable production system for Federated Learning in the domain of mobile devices, based on TensorFlow. In this paper, we describe the resulting high-level design, sketch some of the challenges and their solutions, and touch upon the open problems and future directions."
180,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"We propose an algorithm for the adaptation of the learning rate for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) that avoids the need for validation set use. The idea for the adaptiveness comes from the technique of extrapolation: to get an estimate for the error against the gradient flow which underlies SGD, we compare the result obtained by one full step and two half-steps. The algorithm is applied in two separate frameworks: federated and differentially private learning. Using examples of deep neural networks we empirically show that the adaptive algorithm is competitive with manually tuned commonly used optimisation methods for differentially privately training. We also show that it works robustly in the case of federated learning unlike commonly used optimisation methods."
210,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated learning is a distributed form of machine learning where both the training data and model training are decentralized. In this paper, we use federated learning in a commercial, global-scale setting to train, evaluate and deploy a model to improve virtual keyboard search suggestion quality without direct access to the underlying user data. We describe our observations in federated training, compare metrics to live deployments, and present resulting quality increases. In whole, we demonstrate how federated learning can be applied end-to-end to both improve user experiences and enhance user privacy."
215,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Distributed asynchronous offline training has received widespread attention in recent years because of its high performance on large-scale data and complex models. As data are distributed from cloud-centric to edge nodes, a big challenge for distributed machine learning systems is how to handle native and natural non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data for training. Previous asynchronous training methods do not have a satisfying performance on non-IID data because it would result in that the training process fluctuates greatly which leads to an abnormal convergence. We propose a gradient scheduling algorithm with partly averaged gradients and global momentum (GSGM) for non-IID data distributed asynchronous training. Our key idea is to apply global momentum and local average to the biased gradient after scheduling, in order to make the training process steady. Experimental results show that for non-IID data training under the same experimental conditions, GSGM on popular optimization algorithms can achieve a 20% increase in training stability with a slight improvement in accuracy on Fashion-Mnist and CIFAR-10 datasets. Meanwhile, when expanding distributed scale on CIFAR-100 dataset that results in sparse data distribution, GSGM can perform a 37% improvement on training stability. Moreover, only GSGM can converge well when the number of computing nodes grows to 30, compared to the state-of-the-art distributed asynchronous algorithms. At the same time, GSGM is robust to different degrees of non-IID data."
216,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated Learning is a distributed learning paradigm with two key challenges that differentiate it from traditional distributed optimization: (1) significant variability in terms of the systems characteristics on each device in the network (systems heterogeneity), and (2) non-identically distributed data across the network (statistical heterogeneity). In this work, we introduce a framework, FedProx, to tackle heterogeneity in federated networks. FedProx can be viewed as a generalization and re-parametrization of FedAvg, the current state-of-the-art method for federated learning. While this re-parameterization makes only minor modifications to the method itself, these modifications have important ramifications both in theory and in practice. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for our framework when learning over data from non-identical distributions (statistical heterogeneity), and while adhering to device-level systems constraints by allowing each participating device to perform a variable amount of work (systems heterogeneity). Practically, we demonstrate that FedProx allows for more robust convergence than FedAvg across a suite of realistic federated datasets. In particular, in highly heterogeneous settings, FedProx demonstrates significantly more stable and accurate convergence behavior relative to FedAvg---improving absolute test accuracy by 22% on average."
221,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated learning facilitates the collaborative training of models without the sharing of raw data. However, recent attacks demonstrate that simply maintaining data locality during training processes does not provide sufficient privacy guarantees. Rather, we need a federated learning system capable of preventing inference over both the messages exchanged during training and the final trained model while ensuring the resulting model also has acceptable predictive accuracy. Existing federated learning approaches either use secure multiparty computation (SMC) which is vulnerable to inference or differential privacy which can lead to low accuracy given a large number of parties with relatively small amounts of data each. In this paper, we present an alternative approach that utilizes both differential privacy and SMC to balance these trade-offs. Combining differential privacy with secure multiparty computation enables us to reduce the growth of noise injection as the number of parties increases without sacrificing privacy while maintaining a pre-defined rate of trust. Our system is therefore a scalable approach that protects against inference threats and produces models with high accuracy. Additionally, our system can be used to train a variety of machine learning models, which we validate with experimental results on 3 different machine learning algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach out-performs state of the art solutions."
222,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"In application domains such as healthcare, we want accurate predictive models that are also causally interpretable. In pursuit of such models, we propose a causal regularizer to steer predictive models towards causally-interpretable solutions and theoretically study its properties. In a large-scale analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR), our causally-regularized model outperforms its L1-regularized counterpart in causal accuracy and is competitive in predictive performance. We perform non-linear causality analysis by causally regularizing a special neural network architecture. We also show that the proposed causal regularizer can be used together with neural representation learning algorithms to yield up to 20% improvement over multilayer perceptron in detecting multivariate causation, a situation common in healthcare, where many causal factors should occur simultaneously to have an effect on the target variable."
225,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Federated learning poses new statistical and systems challenges in training machine learning models over distributed networks of devices. In this work, we show that multi-task learning is naturally suited to handle the statistical challenges of this setting, and propose a novel systems-aware optimization method, MOCHA, that is robust to practical systems issues. Our method and theory for the first time consider issues of high communication cost, stragglers, and fault tolerance for distributed multi-task learning. The resulting method achieves significant speedups compared to alternatives in the federated setting, as we demonstrate through simulations on real-world federated datasets."
228,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"Crucial information about the practice of healthcare is recorded only in free-form text, which creates an enormous opportunity for high-impact NLP. However, annotated healthcare datasets tend to be small and expensive to obtain, which raises the question of how to make maximally efficient uses of the available data. To this end, we develop an LSTM-CRF model for combining unsupervised word representations and hand-built feature representations derived from publicly available healthcare ontologies. We show that this combined model yields superior performance on five datasets of diverse kinds of healthcare text (clinical, social, scientific, commercial). Each involves the labeling of complex, multi-word spans that pick out different healthcare concepts. We also introduce a new labeled dataset for identifying the treatment relations between drugs and diseases."
229,0,1,0,yes,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are unevenly distributed over an extremely large number of nodes. The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal.   A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution.   We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results for sparse convex problems. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of \federated optimization."
245,5,1,0,yes,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Structural Causal Models are widely used in causal modelling, but how they relate to other modelling tools is poorly understood. In this paper we provide a novel perspective on the relationship between Ordinary Differential Equations and Structural Causal Models. We show how, under certain conditions, the asymptotic behaviour of an Ordinary Differential Equation under non-constant interventions can be modelled using Dynamic Structural Causal Models. In contrast to earlier work, we study not only the effect of interventions on equilibrium states; rather, we model asymptotic behaviour that is dynamic under interventions that vary in time, and include as a special case the study of static equilibria."
267,5,1,0,yes,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"We consider how an agent should update her beliefs when her beliefs are represented by a set P of probability distributions, given that the agent makes decisions using the minimax criterion, perhaps the best-studied and most commonly-used criterion in the literature. We adopt a game-theoretic framework, where the agent plays against a bookie, who chooses some distribution from P. We consider two reasonable games that differ in what the bookie knows when he makes his choice. Anomalies that have been observed before, like time inconsistency, can be understood as arising because different games are being played, against bookies with different information. We characterize the important special cases in which the optimal decision rules according to the minimax criterion amount to either conditioning or simply ignoring the information. Finally, we consider the relationship between updating and calibration when uncertainty is described by sets of probabilities. Our results emphasize the key role of the rectangularity condition of Epstein and Schneider."
269,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Two architectures that generalize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the processing of signals supported on graphs are introduced. We start with the selection graph neural network (GNN), which replaces linear time invariant filters with linear shift invariant graph filters to generate convolutional features and reinterprets pooling as a possibly nonlinear subsampling stage where nearby nodes pool their information in a set of preselected sample nodes. A key component of the architecture is to remember the position of sampled nodes to permit computation of convolutional features at deeper layers. The second architecture, dubbed aggregation GNN, diffuses the signal through the graph and stores the sequence of diffused components observed by a designated node. This procedure effectively aggregates all components into a stream of information having temporal structure to which the convolution and pooling stages of regular CNNs can be applied. A multinode version of aggregation GNNs is further introduced for operation in large scale graphs. An important property of selection and aggregation GNNs is that they reduce to conventional CNNs when particularized to time signals reinterpreted as graph signals in a circulant graph. Comparative numerical analyses are performed in a source localization application over synthetic and real-world networks. Performance is also evaluated for an authorship attribution problem and text category classification. Multinode aggregation GNNs are consistently the best performing GNN architecture."
270,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"We propose a molecular generative model based on the conditional variational autoencoder for de novo molecular design. It is specialized to control multiple molecular properties simultaneously by imposing them on a latent space. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that it can be used to generate drug-like molecules with five target properties. We were also able to adjust a single property without changing the others and to manipulate it beyond the range of the dataset."
271,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph classification is a significant problem in many scientific domains. It addresses tasks such as the classification of proteins and chemical compounds into categories according to their functions, or chemical and structural properties. In a supervised setting, this problem can be framed as learning the structure, features and relationships between features within a set of labelled graphs and being able to correctly predict the labels or categories of unseen graphs.   A significant difficulty in this task arises when attempting to apply established classification algorithms due to the requirement for fixed size matrix or tensor representations of the graphs which may vary greatly in their numbers of nodes and edges. Building on prior work combining explicit tensor representations with a standard image-based classifier, we propose a model to perform graph classification by extracting fixed size tensorial information from each graph in a given set, and using a Capsule Network to perform classification.   The graphs we consider here are undirected and with categorical features on the nodes. Using standard benchmarking chemical and protein datasets, we demonstrate that our graph Capsule Network classification model using an explicit tensorial representation of the graphs is competitive with current state of the art graph kernels and graph neural network models despite only limited hyper-parameter searching."
277,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph similarity search is among the most important graph-based applications, e.g. finding the chemical compounds that are most similar to a query compound. Graph similarity computation, such as Graph Edit Distance (GED) and Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS), is the core operation of graph similarity search and many other applications, but very costly to compute in practice. Inspired by the recent success of neural network approaches to several graph applications, such as node or graph classification, we propose a novel neural network based approach to address this classic yet challenging graph problem, aiming to alleviate the computational burden while preserving a good performance.   The proposed approach, called SimGNN, combines two strategies. First, we design a learnable embedding function that maps every graph into a vector, which provides a global summary of a graph. A novel attention mechanism is proposed to emphasize the important nodes with respect to a specific similarity metric. Second, we design a pairwise node comparison method to supplement the graph-level embeddings with fine-grained node-level information. Our model achieves better generalization on unseen graphs, and in the worst case runs in quadratic time with respect to the number of nodes in two graphs. Taking GED computation as an example, experimental results on three real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Specifically, our model achieves smaller error rate and great time reduction compared against a series of baselines, including several approximation algorithms on GED computation, and many existing graph neural network based models. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to adopt neural networks to explicitly model the similarity between two graphs, and provide a new direction for future research on graph similarity computation and graph similarity search."
284,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Recently, progress has been made towards improving relational reasoning in machine learning field. Among existing models, graph neural networks (GNNs) is one of the most effective approaches for multi-hop relational reasoning. In fact, multi-hop relational reasoning is indispensable in many natural language processing tasks such as relation extraction. In this paper, we propose to generate the parameters of graph neural networks (GP-GNNs) according to natural language sentences, which enables GNNs to process relational reasoning on unstructured text inputs. We verify GP-GNNs in relation extraction from text. Experimental results on a human-annotated dataset and two distantly supervised datasets show that our model achieves significant improvements compared to baselines. We also perform a qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our model could discover more accurate relations by multi-hop relational reasoning."
287,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Due to its high computational speed and accuracy compared to ab-initio quantum chemistry and forcefield modeling, the prediction of molecular properties using machine learning has received great attention in the fields of materials design and drug discovery. A main ingredient required for machine learning is a training dataset consisting of molecular features\textemdash for example fingerprint bits, chemical descriptors, etc. that adequately characterize the corresponding molecules. However, choosing features for any application is highly non-trivial. No ""universal"" method for feature selection exists. In this work, we propose a data fusion framework that uses Independent Vector Analysis to exploit underlying complementary information contained in different molecular featurization methods, bringing us a step closer to automated feature generation. Our approach takes an arbitrary number of individual feature vectors and automatically generates a single, compact (low dimensional) set of molecular features that can be used to enhance the prediction performance of regression models. At the same time our methodology retains the possibility of interpreting the generated features to discover relationships between molecular structures and properties. We demonstrate this on the QM7b dataset for the prediction of several properties such as atomization energy, polarizability, frontier orbital eigenvalues, ionization potential, electron affinity, and excitation energies. In addition, we show how our method helps improve the prediction of experimental binding affinities for a set of human BACE-1 inhibitors. To encourage more widespread use of IVA we have developed the PyIVA Python package, an open source code which is available for download on Github."
291,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Similarity search over chemical compound databases is a fundamental task in the discovery and design of novel drug-like molecules. Such databases often encode molecules as non-negative integer vectors, called molecular descriptors, which represent rich information on various molecular properties. While there exist efficient indexing structures for searching databases of binary vectors, solutions for more general integer vectors are in their infancy. In this paper we present a time- and space- efficient index for the problem that we call the succinct intervals-splitting tree algorithm for molecular descriptors (SITAd). Our approach extends efficient methods for binary-vector databases, and uses ideas from succinct data structures. Our experiments, on a large database of over 40 million compounds, show SITAd significantly outperforms alternative approaches in practice."
292,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an effective framework for representation learning of graphs. GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance."

We show that these data-driven features are more interpretable, and have better predictive performance on a variety of tasks."
295,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Deep learning architectures have proved versatile in a number of drug discovery applications, including the modelling of in vitro compound activity. While controlling for prediction confidence is essential to increase the trust, interpretability and usefulness of virtual screening models in drug discovery, techniques to estimate the reliability of the predictions generated with deep learning networks remain largely underexplored. Here, we present Deep Confidence, a framework to compute valid and efficient confidence intervals for individual predictions using the deep learning technique Snapshot Ensembling and conformal prediction. Specifically, Deep Confidence generates an ensemble of deep neural networks by recording the network parameters throughout the local minima visited during the optimization phase of a single neural network. This approach serves to derive a set of base learners (i.e., snapshots) with comparable predictive power on average, that will however generate slightly different predictions for a given instance. The variability across base learners and the validation residuals are in turn harnessed to compute confidence intervals using the conformal prediction framework. Using a set of 24 diverse IC50 data sets from ChEMBL 23, we show that Snapshot Ensembles perform on par with Random Forest (RF) and ensembles of independently trained deep neural networks. In addition, we find that the confidence regions predicted using the Deep Confidence framework span a narrower set of values. Overall, Deep Confidence represents a highly versatile error prediction framework that can be applied to any deep learning-based application at no extra computational cost."
296,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been popularly used for analyzing non-Euclidean data such as social network data and biological data. Despite their success, the design of graph neural networks requires a lot of manual work and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Architecture Search method (GraphNAS for short) that enables automatic search of the best graph neural architecture based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, GraphNAS first uses a recurrent network to generate variable-length strings that describe the architectures of graph neural networks, and then trains the recurrent network with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation data set. Extensive experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that GraphNAS can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network. On node classification tasks, GraphNAS can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy."
297,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"A key goal of computational personalized medicine is to systematically utilize genomic and other molecular features of samples to predict drug responses for a previously unseen sample. Such predictions are valuable for developing hypotheses for selecting therapies tailored for individual patients. This is especially valuable in oncology, where molecular and genetic heterogeneity of the cells has a major impact on the response. However, the prediction task is extremely challenging, raising the need for methods that can effectively model and predict drug responses. In this study, we propose a novel formulation of multi-task matrix factorization that allows selective data integration for predicting drug responses. To solve the modeling task, we extend the state-of-the-art kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization (KBMF) method with component-wise multiple kernel learning. In addition, our approach exploits the known pathway information in a novel and biologically meaningful fashion to learn the drug response associations. Our method quantitatively outperforms the state of the art on predicting drug responses in two publicly available cancer data sets as well as on a synthetic data set. In addition, we validated our model predictions with lab experiments using an in-house cancer cell line panel. We finally show the practical applicability of the proposed method by utilizing prior knowledge to infer pathway-drug response associations, opening up the opportunity for elucidating drug action mechanisms. We demonstrate that pathway-response associations can be learned by the proposed model for the well known EGFR and MEK inhibitors."
301,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Convolution Neural Networks on Graphs are important generalization and extension of classical CNNs. While previous works generally assumed that the graph structures of samples are regular with unified dimensions, in many applications, they are highly diverse or even not well defined. Under some circumstances, e.g. chemical molecular data, clustering or coarsening for simplifying the graphs is hard to be justified chemically. In this paper, we propose a more general and flexible graph convolution network (EGCN) fed by batch of arbitrarily shaped data together with their evolving graph Laplacians trained in supervised fashion. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance in terms of both the acceleration of parameter fitting and the significantly improved prediction accuracy on multiple graph-structured datasets."

Unfortunately, GNNs can only be used when such a graph-structure is available. In practice, however, real-world graphs are often noisy and incomplete or might not be available at all. With this work, we propose to jointly learn the graph structure and the parameters of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by approximately solving a bilevel program that learns a discrete probability distribution on the edges of the graph. This allows one to apply GCNs not only in scenarios where the given graph is incomplete or corrupted but also in those where a graph is not available. We conduct a series of experiments that analyze the behavior of the proposed method and demonstrate that it outperforms related methods by a significant margin."
308,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"In silico drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is an important and challenging problem in biomedical research with a huge potential benefit to the pharmaceutical industry and patients. Most existing methods for DTI prediction including deep learning models generally have binary endpoints, which could be an oversimplification of the problem, and those methods are typically unable to handle cold-target problems, i.e., problems involving target protein that never appeared in the training set. Towards this, we contrived PADME (Protein And Drug Molecule interaction prEdiction), a framework based on Deep Neural Networks, to predict real-valued interaction strength between compounds and proteins without requiring feature engineering. PADME takes both compound and protein information as inputs, so it is capable of solving cold-target (and cold-drug) problems. To our knowledge, we are the first to combine Molecular Graph Convolution (MGC) for compound featurization with protein descriptors for DTI prediction. We used multiple cross-validation split schemes and evaluation metrics to measure the performance of PADME on multiple datasets, including the ToxCast dataset, and PADME consistently dominates baseline methods. The results of a case study, which predicts the binding affinity between various compounds and androgen receptor (AR), suggest PADME's potential in drug development. The scalability of PADME is another advantage in the age of Big Data."

We describe two drug-repurposing systems: one, Nascent Ontological Information Retrieval for Drug Repurposing (NOIR-DR), based on an information retrieval strategy, and another, based on non-negative matrix factorization together with compound similarity, that was inspired by recommender systems. We report the performance of both tools on a drug-repurposing task."

We introduce a regularized attention mechanism to GCNNs that not only improves performance on clean datasets, but also favorably accommodates noise in KGs, a pervasive issue in real-world applications. Further, we explore new visualization methods for interpretable modelling and to illustrate how the learned representation can be exploited to automate dataset denoising. The results are demonstrated on a synthetic dataset, the common benchmark dataset FB15k-237, and a large biomedical knowledge graph derived from a combination of noisy and clean data sources. Using these improvements, we visualize a learned model's representation of the disease cystic fibrosis and demonstrate how to interrogate a neural network to show the potential of PPARG as a candidate therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis."

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are information processing architectures tailored to these graph signals and made of stacked layers that compose graph convolutional filters with nonlinear activation functions. Graph convolutions endow GNNs with invariance to permutations of the graph nodes' labels. In this paper, we consider the design of trainable nonlinear activation functions that take into consideration the structure of the graph. This is accomplished by using graph median filters and graph max filters, which mimic linear graph convolutions and are shown to retain the permutation invariance of GNNs. We also discuss modifications to the backpropagation algorithm necessary to train local activation functions. The advantages of localized activation function architectures are demonstrated in four numerical experiments: source localization on synthetic graphs, authorship attribution of 19th century novels, movie recommender systems and scientific article classification.

However, incorporating both graph structure and feature information leads to complex models, and explaining predictions made by GNNs remains unsolved. Here we propose GNNExplainer, the first general, model-agnostic approach for providing interpretable explanations for predictions of any GNN-based model on any graph-based machine learning task. Given an instance, GNNExplainer identifies a compact subgraph structure and a small subset of node features that have a crucial role in GNN's prediction. Further, GNNExplainer can generate consistent and concise explanations for an entire class of instances. We formulate GNNExplainer as an optimization task that maximizes the mutual information between a GNN's prediction and distribution of possible subgraph structures. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our approach can identify important graph structures as well as node features, and outperforms baselines by 17.1% on average. GNNExplainer provides a variety of benefits, from the ability to visualize semantically relevant structures to interpretability, to giving insights into errors of faulty GNNs."
321,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"In recent years machine learning (ML) took bio- and cheminformatics fields by storm, providing new solutions for a vast repertoire of problems related to protein sequence, structure, and interactions analysis. ML techniques, deep neural networks especially, were proven more effective than classical models for tasks like predicting binding affinity for molecular complex. In this work we investigated the earlier stage of drug discovery process - finding druggable pockets on protein surface, that can be later used to design active molecules. For this purpose we developed a 3D fully convolutional neural network capable of binding site segmentation. Our solution has high prediction accuracy and provides intuitive representations of the results, which makes it easy to incorporate into drug discovery projects.

322,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common to treat patients with complex diseases and co-existing conditions. However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is limited because these complex relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality. Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal networks. Decagon predicts the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well side effects with a strong molecular basis, while on predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon creates opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient data to flag and prioritize side effects for follow-up analysis."
325,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Graphs are general and powerful data representations which can model complex real-world phenomena, ranging from chemical compounds to social networks; however, effective feature extraction from graphs is not a trivial task, and much work has been done in the field of machine learning and data mining. The recent advances in graph neural networks have made automatic and flexible feature extraction from graphs possible and have improved the predictive performance significantly. In this paper, we go further with this line of research and address a more general problem of learning with a graph of graphs (GoG) consisting of an external graph and internal graphs, where each node in the external graph has an internal graph structure. We propose a dual convolutional neural network that extracts node representations by combining the external and internal graph structures in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on link prediction tasks using several chemical network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
326,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Minimizing adverse reactions caused by drug-drug interactions has always been a momentous research topic in clinical pharmacology. Detecting all possible interactions through clinical studies before a drug is released to the market is a demanding task. The power of big data is opening up new approaches to discover various drug-drug interactions. However, these discoveries contain a huge amount of noise and provide knowledge bases far from complete and trustworthy ones to be utilized. Most existing studies focus on predicting binary drug-drug interactions between drug pairs but ignore other interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called PRD, to predict drug-drug interactions. The framework uses the graph embedding that can overcome data incompleteness and sparsity issues to achieve multiple DDI label prediction. First, a large-scale drug knowledge graph is generated from different sources. Then, the knowledge graph is embedded with comprehensive biomedical text into a common low dimensional space. Finally, the learned embeddings are used to efficiently compute rich DDI information through a link prediction process. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, extensive experiments were conducted on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of capability and accuracy."

In this paper, we expose and tackle some of the basic weaknesses of a GCNN model with a capsule idea presented in \cite{hinton2011transforming} and propose our Graph Capsule Network (GCAPS-CNN) model. In addition, we design our GCAPS-CNN model to solve especially graph classification problem which current GCNN models find challenging. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed Graph Capsule Network can significantly outperforms both the existing state-of-art deep learning methods and graph kernels on graph classification benchmark datasets."
328,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Many machine learning techniques have been proposed in the last few years to process data represented in graph-structured form. Graphs can be used to model several scenarios, from molecules and materials to RNA secondary structures. Several kernel functions have been defined on graphs that coupled with kernelized learning algorithms, have shown state-of-the-art performances on many tasks. Recently, several definitions of Neural Networks for Graph (GNNs) have been proposed, but their accuracy is not yet satisfying. In this paper, we propose a task-independent pre-training methodology that allows a GNN to learn the representation induced by state-of-the-art graph kernels. Then, the supervised learning phase will fine-tune this representation for the task at hand. The proposed technique is agnostic on the adopted GNN architecture and kernel function, and shows consistent improvements in the predictive performance of GNNs in our preliminary experimental results."
329,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful neural architecture to learn vector representations of nodes and graphs in a supervised, end-to-end fashion. Up to now, GNNs have only been evaluated empirically -- showing promising results. The following work investigates GNNs from a theoretical point of view and relates them to the $1$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman graph isomorphism heuristic ($1$-WL). We show that GNNs have the same expressiveness as the $1$-WL in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic (sub-)graphs. Hence, both algorithms also have the same shortcomings. Based on this, we propose a generalization of GNNs, so-called $k$-dimensional GNNs ($k$-GNNs), which can take higher-order graph structures at multiple scales into account. These higher-order structures play an essential role in the characterization of social networks and molecule graphs. Our experimental evaluation confirms our theoretical findings as well as confirms that higher-order information is useful in the task of graph classification and regression."
332,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"We explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to model spatial processes in which there is no a priori graphical structure. Similar to finite element analysis, we assign nodes of a GNN to spatial locations and use a computational process defined on the graph to model the relationship between an initial function defined over a space and a resulting function in the same space. We use GNNs as a computational substrate, and show that the locations of the nodes in space as well as their connectivity can be optimized to focus on the most complex parts of the space. Moreover, this representational strategy allows the learned input-output relationship to generalize over the size of the underlying space and run the same model at different levels of precision, trading computation for accuracy. We demonstrate this method on a traditional PDE problem, a physical prediction problem from robotics, and learning to predict scene images from novel viewpoints."
333,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"For quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) studies in chemoinformatics, it is important to get interpretable relationship between chemical properties and chemical features. However, the predictive power and interpretability of QSPR models are usually two different objectives that are difficult to achieve simultaneously. A deep learning architecture using molecular graph encoding convolutional neural networks (MGE-CNN) provided a universal strategy to construct interpretable QSPR models with high predictive power. Instead of using application-specific preset molecular descriptors or fingerprints, the models can be resolved using raw and pertinent features without manual intervention or selection. In this study, we developed acute oral toxicity (AOT) models of compounds using the MGE-CNN architecture as a case study. Three types of high-level predictive models: regression model (deepAOT-R), multi-classification model (deepAOT-C) and multi-task model (deepAOT-CR) for AOT evaluation were constructed. These models highly outperformed previously reported models. For the two external datasets containing 1673 (test set I) and 375 (test set II) compounds, the R2 and mean absolute error (MAE) of deepAOT-R on the test set I were 0.864 and 0.195, and the prediction accuracy of deepAOT-C was 95.5% and 96.3% on the test set I and II, respectively. The two external prediction accuracy of deepAOT-CR is 95.0% and 94.1%, while the R2 and MAE are 0.861 and 0.204 for test set I, respectively."
335,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"In de novo drug design, computational strategies are used to generate novel molecules with good affinity to the desired biological target. In this work, we show that recurrent neural networks can be trained as generative models for molecular structures, similar to statistical language models in natural language processing. We demonstrate that the properties of the generated molecules correlate very well with the properties of the molecules used to train the model. In order to enrich libraries with molecules active towards a given biological target, we propose to fine-tune the model with small sets of molecules, which are known to be active against that target.   Against Staphylococcus aureus, the model reproduced 14% of 6051 hold-out test molecules that medicinal chemists designed, whereas against Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria) it reproduced 28% of 1240 test molecules. When coupled with a scoring function, our model can perform the complete de novo drug design cycle to generate large sets of novel molecules for drug discovery."
338,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) plays a key role in predicting candidate drugs, toxicity, therapeutic effects, and biological functions. In various types of chemical analyses, computational approaches are often required due to the amount of data that needs to be handled. The recent remarkable growth and outstanding performance of deep learning have attracted considerable research attention. However,even in state-of-the-art drug analysis methods, deep learning continues to be used only as a classifier, although deep learning is capable of not only simple classification but also automated feature extraction. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end learning method for CCI, named DeepCCI. Hidden features are derived from a simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES), which is a string notation representing the chemical structure, instead of learning from crafted features. To discover hidden representations for the SMILES strings, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To guarantee the commutative property for homogeneous interaction, we apply model sharing and hidden representation merging techniques. The performance of DeepCCI was compared with a plain deep classifier and conventional machine learning methods. The proposed DeepCCI showed the best performance in all seven evaluation metrics used. In addition, the commutative property was experimentally validated. The automatically extracted features through end-to-end SMILES learning alleviates the significant efforts required for manual feature engineering. It is expected to improve prediction performance, in drug analyses."
339,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"We address a fundamental problem in chemistry known as chemical reaction product prediction. Our main insight is that the input reactant and reagent molecules can be jointly represented as a graph, and the process of generating product molecules from reactant molecules can be formulated as a sequence of graph transformations. To this end, we propose Graph Transformation Policy Network (GTPN) -- a novel generic method that combines the strengths of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to learn the reactions directly from data with minimal chemical knowledge. Compared to previous methods, GTPN has some appealing properties such as: end-to-end learning, and making no assumption about the length or the order of graph transformations. In order to guide model search through the complex discrete space of sets of bond changes effectively, we extend the standard policy gradient loss by adding useful constraints. Evaluation results show that GTPN improves the top-1 accuracy over the current state-of-the-art method by about 3% on the large USPTO dataset. Our model's performances and prediction errors are also analyzed carefully in the paper."
341,6,1,0,yes,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"Molecular ""fingerprints"" encoding structural information are the workhorse of cheminformatics and machine learning in drug discovery applications. However, fingerprint representations necessarily emphasize particular aspects of the molecular structure while ignoring others, rather than allowing the model to make data-driven decisions. We describe molecular ""graph convolutions"", a machine learning architecture for learning from undirected graphs, specifically small molecules. Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular graph---atoms, bonds, distances, etc.---which allows the model to take greater advantage of information in the graph structure. Although graph convolutions do not outperform all fingerprint-based methods, they (along with other graph-based methods) represent a new paradigm in ligand-based virtual screening with exciting opportunities for future improvement."

Using machine learning techniques, we accurately predict pairwise interactions, which can be of medical and biological importance. Graphs are are useful in this problem for their generality to all types of molecules, due to the inherent association of atoms through atomic bonds. Subgraphs can represent different molecular domains. These domains can be biologically significant as most molecules only have portions that are of functional significance and can interact with other domains. Thus, we use subgraphs as features in different machine learning algorithms to predict if two drugs interact and predict potential single molecule effects."

Computational techniques can be used to predict potential drug-drug interactions. We approach the drug-drug interaction prediction problem as a link prediction problem and present two novel methods for drug-drug interaction prediction based on artificial neural networks and factor propagation over graph nodes: adjacency matrix factorization (AMF) and adjacency matrix factorization with propagation (AMFP). We conduct a retrospective analysis by training our models on a previous release of the DrugBank database with 1,141 drugs and 45,296 drug-drug interactions and evaluate the results on a later version of DrugBank with 1,440 drugs and 248,146 drug-drug interactions. Additionally, we perform a holdout analysis using DrugBank. We report an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score of 0.807 and 0.990 for the retrospective and holdout analyses respectively. Finally, we create an ensemble-based classifier using AMF, AMFP, and existing link prediction methods and obtain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.814 and 0.991 for the retrospective and the holdout analyses. We demonstrate that AMF and AMFP provide state of the art results compared to existing methods and that the ensemble-based classifier improves the performance by combining various predictors. These results suggest that AMF, AMFP, and the proposed ensemble-based classifier can provide important information during drug development and regarding drug prescription given only partial or noisy data. These methods can also be used to solve other link prediction problems.

In this paper, we are interested to design neural networks for graphs with variable length in order to solve learning problems such as vertex classification, graph classification, graph regression, and graph generative tasks. Most existing works have focused on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn meaningful representations of graphs, and more recently new convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been introduced. In this work, we want to compare rigorously these two fundamental families of architectures to solve graph learning tasks. We review existing graph RNN and ConvNet architectures, and propose natural extension of LSTM and ConvNet to graphs with arbitrary size. Then, we design a set of analytically controlled experiments on two basic graph problems, i.e. subgraph matching and graph clustering, to test the different architectures. Numerical results show that the proposed graph ConvNets are 3-17% more accurate and 1.5-4x faster than graph RNNs. Graph ConvNets are also 36% more accurate than variational (non-learning) techniques. Finally, the most effective graph ConvNet architecture uses gated edges and residuality. Residuality plays an essential role to learn multi-layer architectures as they provide a 10% gain of performance."
