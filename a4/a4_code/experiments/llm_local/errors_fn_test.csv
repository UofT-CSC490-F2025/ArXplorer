3,0,0,1,no,How does Federated Learning perform in non-IID data environments for healthcare?,"On-device machine learning (ML) enables the training process to exploit a massive amount of user-generated private data samples. To enjoy this benefit, inter-device communication overhead should be minimized. With this end, we propose federated distillation (FD), a distributed model training algorithm whose communication payload size is much smaller than a benchmark scheme, federated learning (FL), particularly when the model size is large. Moreover, user-generated data samples are likely to become non-IID across devices, which commonly degrades the performance compared to the case with an IID dataset. To cope with this, we propose federated augmentation (FAug), where each device collectively trains a generative model, and thereby augments its local data towards yielding an IID dataset. Empirical studies demonstrate that FD with FAug yields around 26x less communication overhead while achieving 95-98% test accuracy compared to FL."
6,5,0,1,no,Investigating causal inference methods to understand treatment effects in economics.,"Consider the case that one observes a single time-series, where at each time t one observes a data record O(t) involving treatment nodes A(t), possible covariates L(t) and an outcome node Y(t). The data record at time t carries information for an (potentially causal) effect of the treatment A(t) on the outcome Y(t), in the context defined by a fixed dimensional summary measure Co(t). We are concerned with defining causal effects that can be consistently estimated, with valid inference, for sequentially randomized experiments without further assumptions. More generally, we consider the case when the (possibly causal) effects can be estimated in a double robust manner, analogue to double robust estimation of effects in the i.i.d. causal inference literature. We propose a general class of averages of conditional (context-specific) causal parameters that can be estimated in a double robust manner, therefore fully utilizing the sequential randomization. We propose a targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) of these causal parameters, and present a general theorem establishing the asymptotic consistency and normality of the TMLE. We extend our general framework to a number of typically studied causal target parameters, including a sequentially adaptive design within a single unit that learns the optimal treatment rule for the unit over time. Our work opens up robust statistical inference for causal questions based on observing a single time-series on a particular unit."
20,6,0,1,no,Survey of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.,"The Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug candidates are estimated to account for up to 50% of all clinical trial failures. Predicting ADMET properties has therefore been of great interest to the cheminformatics and medicinal chemistry communities in recent decades. Traditional cheminformatics approaches, whether the learner is a random forest or a deep neural network, leverage fixed fingerprint feature representations of molecules. In contrast, in this paper, we learn the features most relevant to each chemical task at hand by representing each molecule explicitly as a graph, where each node is an atom and each edge is a bond. By applying graph convolutions to this explicit molecular representation, we achieve, to our knowledge, unprecedented accuracy in prediction of ADMET properties. By challenging our methodology with rigorous cross-validation procedures and prospective analyses, we show that deep featurization better enables molecular predictors to not only interpolate but also extrapolate to new regions of chemical space."
34,20,0,1,no,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"Deep learning for clinical applications is subject to stringent performance requirements, which raises a need for large labeled datasets. However, the enormous cost of labeling medical data makes this challenging. In this paper, we build a cost-sensitive active learning system for the problem of intracranial hemorrhage detection and segmentation on head computed tomography (CT). We show that our ensemble method compares favorably with the state-of-the-art, while running faster and using less memory. Moreover, our experiments are done using a substantially larger dataset than earlier papers on this topic. Since the labeling time could vary tremendously across examples, we model the labeling time and optimize the return on investment. We validate this idea by core-set selection on our large labeled dataset and by growing it with data from the wild."
35,20,0,1,no,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"We introduce a novel strategy for learning to extract semantically meaningful features from aerial imagery. Instead of manually labeling the aerial imagery, we propose to predict (noisy) semantic features automatically extracted from co-located ground imagery. Our network architecture takes an aerial image as input, extracts features using a convolutional neural network, and then applies an adaptive transformation to map these features into the ground-level perspective. We use an end-to-end learning approach to minimize the difference between the semantic segmentation extracted directly from the ground image and the semantic segmentation predicted solely based on the aerial image. We show that a model learned using this strategy, with no additional training, is already capable of rough semantic labeling of aerial imagery. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by finetuning this model we can achieve more accurate semantic segmentation than two baseline initialization strategies. We use our network to address the task of estimating the geolocation and geoorientation of a ground image. Finally, we show how features extracted from an aerial image can be used to hallucinate a plausible ground-level panorama."
36,20,0,1,no,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"While active learning offers potential cost savings, the actual data efficiency---the reduction in amount of labeled data needed to obtain the same error rate---observed in practice is mixed. This paper poses a basic question: when is active learning actually helpful? We provide an answer for logistic regression with the popular active learning algorithm, uncertainty sampling. Empirically, on 21 datasets from OpenML, we find a strong inverse correlation between data efficiency and the error rate of the final classifier. Theoretically, we show that for a variant of uncertainty sampling, the asymptotic data efficiency is within a constant factor of the inverse error rate of the limiting classifier."
41,20,0,1,no,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"We design an active learning algorithm for cost-sensitive multiclass classification: problems where different errors have different costs. Our algorithm, COAL, makes predictions by regressing to each label's cost and predicting the smallest. On a new example, it uses a set of regressors that perform well on past data to estimate possible costs for each label. It queries only the labels that could be the best, ignoring the sure losers. We prove COAL can be efficiently implemented for any regression family that admits squared loss optimization; it also enjoys strong guarantees with respect to predictive performance and labeling effort. We empirically compare COAL to passive learning and several active learning baselines, showing significant improvements in labeling effort and test cost on real-world datasets."
42,20,0,1,no,How can active learning minimize labeling cost for semantic segmentation datasets?,"Active learning refers to the learning protocol where the learner is allowed to choose a subset of instances for labeling. Previous studies have shown that, compared with passive learning, active learning is able to reduce the label complexity exponentially if the data are linearly separable or satisfy the Tsybakov noise condition with parameter $\kappa=1$. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm using a convex surrogate loss, with the goal to broaden the cases for which active learning achieves an exponential improvement. We make use of a convex loss not only because it reduces the computational cost, but more importantly because it leads to a tight bound for the empirical process (i.e., the difference between the empirical estimation and the expectation) when the current solution is close to the optimal one. Under the assumption that the norm of the optimal classifier that minimizes the convex risk is available, our analysis shows that the introduction of the convex surrogate loss yields an exponential reduction in the label complexity even when the parameter $\kappa$ of the Tsybakov noise is larger than $1$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that improves the minimax rate of active learning by utilizing certain priori knowledge."
58,43,0,1,no,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"With the emergence of Web 2.0 technology and the expansion of on-line social networks, current Internet users have the ability to add their reviews, ratings and opinions on social media and on commercial and news web sites. Sentiment analysis aims to classify these reviews reviews in an automatic way. In the literature, there are numerous approaches proposed for automatic sentiment analysis for different language contexts. Each language has its own properties that makes the sentiment analysis more challenging. In this regard, this work presents a comprehensive survey of existing Arabic sentiment analysis studies, and covers the various approaches and techniques proposed in the literature. Moreover, we highlight the main difficulties and challenges of Arabic sentiment analysis, and the proposed techniques in literature to overcome these barriers."
60,43,0,1,no,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"So far different studies have tackled the sentiment analysis in several domains such as restaurant and movie reviews. But, this problem has not been studied in scholarly book reviews which is different in terms of review style and size. In this paper, we propose to combine different features in order to be presented to a supervised classifiers which extract the opinion target expressions and detect their polarities in scholarly book reviews. We construct a labeled corpus for training and evaluating our methods in French book reviews. We also evaluate them on English restaurant reviews in order to measure their robustness across the domains and languages. The evaluation shows that our methods are enough robust for English restaurant reviews and French book reviews."
66,43,0,1,no,Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.,"This paper examines the efficacy of different optimization techniques in a primal formulation of a support vector machine (SVM). Three main techniques are compared. The dataset used to compare all three techniques was the Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews dataset, from kaggle.com."
82,48,0,1,no,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"Learning good feature embeddings for images often requires substantial training data. As a consequence, in settings where training data is limited (e.g., few-shot and zero-shot learning), we are typically forced to use a generic feature embedding across various tasks. Ideally, we want to construct feature embeddings that are tuned for the given task. In this work, we propose Task-Aware Feature Embedding Networks (TAFE-Nets) to learn how to adapt the image representation to a new task in a meta learning fashion. Our network is composed of a meta learner and a prediction network. Based on a task input, the meta learner generates parameters for the feature layers in the prediction network so that the feature embedding can be accurately adjusted for that task. We show that TAFE-Net is highly effective in generalizing to new tasks or concepts and evaluate the TAFE-Net on a range of benchmarks in zero-shot and few-shot learning. Our model matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art on all tasks. In particular, our approach improves the prediction accuracy of unseen attribute-object pairs by 4 to 15 points on the challenging visual attribute-object composition task."
86,48,0,1,no,Meta-learning methods for few-shot language modeling with limited training data.,"The field of few-shot learning has been laboriously explored in the supervised setting, where per-class labels are available. On the other hand, the unsupervised few-shot learning setting, where no labels of any kind are required, has seen little investigation. We propose a method, named Assume, Augment and Learn or AAL, for generating few-shot tasks using unlabeled data. We randomly label a random subset of images from an unlabeled dataset to generate a support set. Then by applying data augmentation on the support set's images, and reusing the support set's labels, we obtain a target set. The resulting few-shot tasks can be used to train any standard meta-learning framework. Once trained, such a model, can be directly applied on small real-labeled datasets without any changes or fine-tuning required. In our experiments, the learned models achieve good generalization performance in a variety of established few-shot learning tasks on Omniglot and Mini-Imagenet."
93,57,0,1,no,Attention mechanisms for question answering on long-form texts.,"Recently, the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task has gained increasing attention in artificial intelligence. Existing VQA methods mainly adopt the visual attention mechanism to associate the input question with corresponding image regions for effective question answering. The free-form region based and the detection-based visual attention mechanisms are mostly investigated, with the former ones attending free-form image regions and the latter ones attending pre-specified detection-box regions. We argue that the two attention mechanisms are able to provide complementary information and should be effectively integrated to better solve the VQA problem. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network for VQA that integrates both attention mechanisms. Our proposed framework effectively fuses features from free-form image regions, detection boxes, and question representations via a multi-modal multiplicative feature embedding scheme to jointly attend question-related free-form image regions and detection boxes for more accurate question answering. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on two publicly available datasets, COCO-QA and VQA, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Source code is available at https://github.com/lupantech/dual-mfa-vqa."
94,61,0,1,no,Improving text classification using attention and memory-augmented networks.,"In this paper, we exploit a memory-augmented neural network to predict accurate answers to visual questions, even when those answers occur rarely in the training set. The memory network incorporates both internal and external memory blocks and selectively pays attention to each training exemplar. We show that memory-augmented neural networks are able to maintain a relatively long-term memory of scarce training exemplars, which is important for visual question answering due to the heavy-tailed distribution of answers in a general VQA setting. Experimental results on two large-scale benchmark datasets show the favorable performance of the proposed algorithm with a comparison to state of the art."
97,72,0,1,no,Deep learning approaches for part-of-speech tagging on large datasets.,Sparsity is one of the major problems in natural language processing. The problem becomes even more severe in agglutinating languages that are highly prone to be inflected. We deal with sparsity in Turkish by adopting morphological features for part-of-speech tagging. We learn inflectional and derivational morpheme tags in Turkish by using conditional random fields (CRF) and we employ the morpheme tags in part-of-speech (PoS) tagging by using hidden Markov models (HMMs) to mitigate sparsity. Results show that using morpheme tags in PoS tagging helps alleviate the sparsity in emission probabilities. Our model outperforms other hidden Markov model based PoS tagging models for small training datasets in Turkish. We obtain an accuracy of 94.1% in morpheme tagging and 89.2% in PoS tagging on a 5K training dataset.
105,72,0,1,no,Deep learning approaches for part-of-speech tagging on large datasets.,"In this paper, we are going to focus on speed up of the Word Sense Disambiguation procedure by filtering the relevant senses of an ambiguous word through Part-of-Speech Tagging. First, this proposed approach performs the Part-of-Speech Tagging operation before the disambiguation procedure using Bigram approximation. As a result, the exact Part-of-Speech of the ambiguous word at a particular text instance is derived. In the next stage, only those dictionary definitions (glosses) are retrieved from an online dictionary, which are associated with that particular Part-of-Speech to disambiguate the exact sense of the ambiguous word. In the training phase, we have used Brown Corpus for Part-of-Speech Tagging and WordNet as an online dictionary. The proposed approach reduces the execution time upto half (approximately) of the normal execution time for a text, containing around 200 sentences. Not only that, we have found several instances, where the correct sense of an ambiguous word is found for using the Part-of-Speech Tagging before the Disambiguation procedure."
118,93,0,1,no,Fast algorithms for solving linear regression problems,In this note we propose a new approach towards solving numerically optimal stopping problems via reinforced regression based Monte Carlo algorithms. The main idea of the method is to reinforce standard linear regression algorithms in each backward induction step by adding new basis functions based on previously estimated continuation values. The proposed methodology is illustrated by a numerical example from mathematical finance.
